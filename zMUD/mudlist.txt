Mud         : The Original Leviathan
Code Base   : [LP] Leviathan (NM IVa)
Telnet      : leviathan.betterbox.net 1691 [209.83.132.83]
WWW         : http://leviathan.betterbox.net/
Description :

   After beta testing for more than 14 months, Leviathan opened on November
1, 1995.  Since then, we've been picking up new players every day, who
insist that the environment that we've created is the most dynamic, 
literate, and compelling one of its kind.  Rather than create a vast,
sprawling megapolis for bloodthirsty hyper-mudders to dash through
maniacally, we've opted for dynamism, comprehensive descriptions, and
imaginative areas and quests.

   With regards to theme, we've taken a rather unique approach.  The central
City of the White Mage is decidedly medieval in tone, but as the daring
adventurer wanders further into the wilderness, s/he may find a diversity
of creatures from a multitude of milieux.  Indeed, investigative
exploration may often result in quite bizarre discoveries!

   Finally, the dedicated and sympathetic staff of Immortals make
playing Leviathan an especially rewarding experience.  We frequently
listen to and act on player suggestions regarding new spells, items, and
other features of the mud.

   For excellence in an LPmud, experience Leviathan.

the past and ripped forth the town of Sunnydale, intact, and
with it the Mouth into Hell. With the Hell-mouth re-opened
it did not take long for the forces of evil to begin to
gather in the town above it and as they mustered so too did
Champions flock from the world over to combat them and so
the town repopulated with these new arrivals... New
arrivals such as yourself, with the power to save the

Description :

 Established in 1996, Aardwolf has grown to be one of the most
popular MUDs online with over 400 players online at any time.
After over 6 years of development, the MUD bears little
resemblance to the original. Seven classes to remort into and a
'tiers' system tiers' allows for a combination of 14,070 total
levels, meaning you're going to be busy for quite a few
weekends. Completely revised statistics that actually MEAN
something, you'll be able to create the character of your dreams.
 
Players can acquire quest and trivia points through automated
quests, competitive global quests or lengthy and difficult
'campaigns'. These points can be used to purchasing a manor,
to buy 'wishes' to make gaming lives easier, or spent on a
wide range of special equipment and weapons. Want more? Nearly
30 specialised player run clans with a variety of themes for
everyone. Optional PlayerKilling available to these clans, or
if that's not to your taste, some of these clans are none PK.
 
How about wars, where players can compete in teams based on race,
class, rank, or just have a free for all? Or visit one of the many
combat mazes on the MUD, where anything goes. Or challenge someone
to a duel using our interference-free duel system. Or, if you're
not feeling particularly violent, choose from one of the dozens of
fully customisable channelsavailable and simply chat to your
heart's content. And this is only the basics. We have lasertag
arenas, blackjack tables, florists, t-shirt shops. We even, for
some reason, have weasels. Give Aardwolf a try today..........

  Abandoned Realms is a highly modified diku mud.  The objective of
the mud is to focus on gameplay.  We want a MUD where people can

gameplay.  Gameplay to us is having rich themes to our areas, various
creatures that talk to players instead of just sitting around, and
well balanced race/classes. 

  We have an extended help file system, a newbie chat for those
unfamiliar with this kind of MUD, and plenty of friendly imms willing
to answer your questions.  There are 16 races and 16 classes each
unique with their advantages and disadvantages.  New races and
classes are consistently being added and the old ones refined to
preserve gameplay. There are also seven cabals, with plans to add
more in the future. 

  We enforce roleplaying here, we like to see players who have unique
backgrounds, enjoy being memorable characters, and in turn,  meeting
other memorable characters.  We also have mob runned quests that will
improve certain aspects of your character.  

  Although we do encourage player killing, we also discourage
senseless slaughter.  We have refined the gameplay so that brains
will win over brawn because nobody likes boring hack and slash.  We
test our pk ranges thoroughly for fairness. If you enjoy roleplaying
in a complex and vast world mixed with the thrills of playerkilling
then Abandoned Realms is for you.

 Come to LOTJ and enter a gaming experience where the players have
all lent a hand in making a galaxy filled with worlds to enjoy.
Think of three major eras of the Star Wars story played out
throughout the course of a year, travel through Mandalore and see
the armies born on Kamino. See the rise of the usurper and the fall of
his rule, and the pheonix of peace born from the ashes of a dead sith
lord.

 On LOTJ each planet can be governed by a major clan. The governing
body can set up a leader for the planet, who sets up his government.
Members of the greater clan can work as agents of the planetary
government, with their own channel so that they and their fellows can
collaborate.

 We also offer our players the chance to take an idea, a concept, and
make a clan of their own. Our webpage offers an online method for
submitting applications, for things ranging from forcers to clans to
anything your creative mind can imagine that wouldn't be out of place
in SW.

 Although our mud is a PKILL environment, we also have a very user-
friendly account system that lets our players garnish points from the
death of characters and then use those points to purchase levels for
new characters. This is done when someone is "permed", which is our
way of saying ultimately dead. 

 Players elect our main decision making body: the RolePlay Council
(RPC). When someone is "permed" and they believe proper RP/RULES
observations weren't made, or that some sort of foul play was at hand,
they turn to this elected group of seven individuals.  They discuss it
amongst themselves and render judgement upon the situation, giving our
Player Representatives team the decision to render punishment if
required.

 With a max players of 113 scored as of April 24, 2005 we offer a wide
variety of player interaction. Come see what you've been missing!

 o Detailed characters created in collaboration between player and staff.
 o A unique fantasy world where original creations replace the standards.

 o An always evolving world full with intrigues for players to plot on.
 o Deadly combat and permanent death to promote talking before fighting.
 o Combat is non-automatic and slow, but detailed and allows for control.

minutes having nothing to do until the next player logs on, then 
Manic Dreams is the place for you!  We offer a unique style to obtain 
spells and skills through quests offered by each class's guild 
master.  Although we are not completely finished with the world or 
the codebase, we are looking for a staff that is willing to help 
contribute to the undertaking that will provide the MUDing community 
with a Dystopia that isn't solely based on playerkilling.  We are 
trying to offer a more extensive player customization and 
progression.  We offer detailed areas that will keep you guessing 
where the hidden doors are and where they may lead.  Our builders are 
continually thinking of new ways to intrigue the player, with 
detailed room descriptions and nicely themed areas.  If you feel you 
could contribute to our staff or you would just like to see how our 
progress is, come and stop by.  Our staff is friendly and will help 
with whatever they can!

Code Base   : [Custom]
Telnet      : vortexmud.org 9999 [68.9.33.158]
WWW         : http://www.vortexmud.org
Description :

 100 years have past since any form of life inhabited the
Vortex universe. The Gods of Vortex and Oblivion had
decimated all of the life in Vortex with their great war.
It was so great it brought about the apocalypse. Even the
Gods could not escape their own fate and were confined by
it. Now a re-awakening has occurred. The Gods of Vortex
have begun to wander the world again, discovering a new
civilization has developed. Android Seventeen has rebuilt
Satan City and rules over the Earth with an army of android
warriors. What's left if any of the Z-fighters must now
band together with the people of earth to battle against
Seventeen and regain control of the earth.
 
 Vortex has a very newbie-friendly atmosphere, there are
extensive help files and even experienced players who are
always more than willing to help new people with any
troubles they may have. The role-play element in Vortex is
very strong; we encourage it and also have Immortal driven
storylines that can spawn off areas or even to add a new
skill to the game. We are also constantly expanding the
game by coding in new and exciting features, areas, races
and skills. We're always expanding so that you'll never run
out of things to do, and as always we pride ourselves in
trying to achieve the most exciting and fun environment for
our players.
 
We hope to see you soon.

Description :

  The Abysmal Realms MUD is a Roleplaying/Playerkilling MUD
derived from ROM2.4 code.  The Realms opened to the public 
May 1st, 1997 and has grown steadily since then. Those 
accustomed to ROM playing will be pleased with the 
enhancements we've made while still retaining the best of 
the ROM 'look and feel'. Realism, attention to detail and 
enhanced user interface have been our top priorities.  The 
focal point of Abysmal Realms is our clan system. Those new 
to Role Play will find it natural to fall into RP mode 
because of the distinct personalities and purposes of each 
clan.  We find best role players often prove to be the first 
time mudders!  We have a clan that is dedicated to life and 
helping those that are inexperienced learn. Again, you can 
visit our web site for info on the clans.  Though PK is 
supported, it is judged by strict standards of a
ppropriateness within the RP context maintained here.  We 
have user-selectable ANSI color, many spam reducing 
features, and questmasters available for questing anytime.  
The mud is served by a conscientious and talented staff of 
immortals. We also have an mprog driven economy, where many
things are 'made' by mobs, and we are striving to include 
every item in the realms in a like manner. Watch as items 
are picked, gathered, or mined and then processed into 
foods, weapons, armors, and potions. WE HAVE NOT HAD A 
PWIPE SINCE OPENING, and do not plan on one in the future.

Description :

   Age of Dragons was originally created in 1996. Since
that time the MUD has gone through many changes in order
to improve the original world we have created. We now 
have over 150 zones throughout the MUD, along with three 
major cities that players of all different alignments call 
home.

   Some of the code we use on Age of Dragons includes a 
memorization system, where players actually memorize their
spells instead of using mana, detailed descriptions for 
players so that they can customize their characters to the
fullest extent, an introduction system which allows 
players to pick and choose which players they wish to be 
associated with, and an approval system for new characters 
that ensures only players with appropriate descriptions 
and names will be a part of our world. 

   Numerous different skills and spells from the original 
and new age of Dungeons and Dragons have been included for 
players to have at their disposal, we offer eight different 
races, and eleven different classes to choose from.

   Age of Dragons is a MUD like no other. Our originality,
ability to obtain unique objects through quests, and 
rewards for good roleplaying will make Age of Dragons your 
newest addiction.

   Happy MUDding, and good luck to you all.

  Achaea is a completely original high fantasy mud coded from

competitive economic systems, and more. We are the gold standard.
But you don't have to take our word for it:

'I don't believe there's another game in existence with this much
depth.' - John Romero, Co-designer of Doom and Quake

'Few virtual worlds with an immensely complicated combat system
avoid being completely dominated by it -- Achaea is the best-known
exception.' -- Dr. Richard Bartle, the inventor of MUDs.

lies the Hesperian Realm. From the Black Fortress and foul armies of the
Dark Lord, all the way to the Paradise of the Covenant, you will recognize
a theme of the utmost tragedy: a love story which shaped the perpetual war
raging on Hesperia.

Brutally thrown into this realm because of your own stupidity, you decide
to make the best out of it. Motivated by the interest the Immortals seem
to take in recruiting Earthlings, you vigorously start your career.'

Hesperia is a medieval fantasy mud originating from an ENVY 2.0 base code.
For eight years our Staff has worked on the large Hesperia project, shaping
an all original world of over 20000 rooms. There are over 300 spells and
skills, numerous quests and games to try out, as well as the opportunity
to join cults and progress through the 550 levels we currently offer. We are

  AAW is an ever evolving MUD, many new and unique features have
been coded into the game. Most MUDS have mprogs, but how many
out there offer substantial oprogs and rprogs, so that objects
and even rooms can interact with you and your characters
actions? We also have an extensive pet system. Pets can be
leveled, wear EQ and even have custom names and descriptions.
 
We also RDL (Room Description Langue) which allows builders
the ability to make it so that room descriptions (and other
things) say one thing in daytime and another at night, or
to have descriptions in the different languages of the realm.
MSP (Mud Sound Protocol) is in and many of our areas now have
their own .midi files attached to enhance the play experience.
 
AAW offers many races and classes, with more to come. All
characters are dual classed so that you get all spells/skills
from your primary class and s/s up to level 30 in your second
class, yielding an immense range of possible combinations.
 
New original areas are constantly in development, and our
aim is at having totally original world one day!
At the time being we are half way there.

So take some time,

Adventures Unlimited began over 5 years ago as a modest stock 
rom mud with not much more to offer than any of the thousands of
other stock muds. Over the years, the mud has grown into a multi-
faceted community with a detailed world, consistent roleplay and
many features. 

We pride ourselves in bringing a game with integrity, stamina and
honesty to our players. Our channels are free of cursing and the
environment is strictly PG. Our players are friendly and helpful
especially when aiding a new player. Our immortal staff is
talented, experienced and dedicated. Many of the staff have been
part of AU for over 4 years. 

Adventures Unlimited is not a cookie cutter rom based mud. The 
development has been focused not on what other muds provide to
their players but instead on the path that AU occupies alone. 
The land of Tharel has been developed continuously throughout the
years of the existing of AU. It has gone from a completely stock
world with no original areas to 75% original with over 10,000
rooms.

Our numbers are not among the highest in the mud community, but we
have high player satisfaction and provide a quality product to our
players. Please come and join our community!

     It's called Unknown Epicentres, or UEI for short.  Yeah, the acronym
has more letters than it should.  We saved enough on server rent that we
were able to afford an extra vowel.
 
     UEI is a quasi-private social MUCK that started as a sort of moving
away from the overwhelming furry populations of most MUCKs.  We wanted more
style and intelligence in our conversations and chillspaces and less in the
way of yiffing and scritching.
 
     So it's pretty small and personal.  RP is possible and encouraged but
there hasn't been a whole lot taking place yet.  Right now it's just a
laundromat for slackers to hang out in and talk about.. stuff.  Also
illustrators are very welcome.  Yeah.
 
     Cor, what a crummy description for a muck.  If you think this sounds at
all interesting, have a see of the abortive web page.  If you're still
there, drop a line via email and we'll talk.
 
     Notice:  The address and port of UEI are intentionally unlisted.  Once

  Our mud is a complex and 'real' fantasy world. We encourage
roleplay, though we don't enforce it. The tuneable global channel
may be used only for newbie related questions. There are no levels

quests or by exploring new places rather than by killing the same
monster repeatedly. It is a unique blend of a hack & slash and a
roleplaying mud. You really live in the world, it is not just
theatrical roleplay. There are many features that keep you busy
exploring, so you won't fall back to boring hack and slash routine.
Mud features: 20+ open guilds. Most of these guilds are led by
players so admission in a guild is not always automatic. Complex
monetary system. 20 playable races with their own language. About
120 spells and 90+ different skills. Unknown characters will be
seen by their appearance rather than names. Team system supports
back row for spellcasters and archers. Weather. Overland map.
Combat includes bleeding, unconsciousness, breaking or severing of
limbs. Special races: flying races, water breathing races etc.
and a lot more. 60+ unique quests (not autoquests). Numerical values
are shown as text or displayed by bars. Players are entitled for
detailed character generation after they have already spent some
time playing the game. Detailed character generation includes a
background story which could be standard or player supplied. Players
can own houses with saved equipment. Crafts include forging, carving 
and tailoring. User stats are available

 The Dragon is gone...
 The Dark One is no more...
 With the new breaking, the very fabric of the world has been torn asunder; unimaginable
horrors now roam the realm where dreams and nightmares are no longer bound to the world
of Tel'aran'rhiod. The Wheel of Time no longer spins by the hand of the Creator, while
heroes of the past are now of the present. Civilizations sundered by the trial of Ages
now flourish once more. No longer are their futures predetermined... no longer is one's
destiny bound to another^Ò. And out of Chaos, new powers emerge... 


- 13 different classes to choose from. 

- 12 different races to choose from, including Ancient Races should you challenge the 
  insidious Labyrinth.

  and different playing styles.

that roam the world.

The game is small with a friendly and dedicated player base
looking for people interested in the freedom of pure RP. We offer
player-run plotlines, broadranging story arcs, and the excitement
of adventuring RP where new areas of the MUSH will be discovered.

Player Killing is limited in such that if you are player 
killed by another person, they may only loot *one* item 
from your corpse.

    We are not a heavy Role Playing MUD, but neither are we 
without RP. Each guild must follow the path Robert Jordan

Epoch has a graphical web interface that is very similar

 We are now looking to build a fantasy / medieval world on

possibly coders.  Epoch is not based on any other MUD

Description :

 Age of the Throne is unique MUD in more ways than one, we have written
the game from scratch using our very own programming language and we 
have also aimed for a theme found nowhere else in the Gaming World.
Set in fashionable 17th Century Paris the game evokes and emulates the
period of History that saw King Louis XIII on the throne of France,
Cardinal Richelieu as Head of the Church and the constant rivalries that
ensued between the Kings Musketeers and The Cardinals Guard.  The
locations within the game are replicated from original maps of the time.

As our programming language does not restrict us we are free to implement
many original and interesting features into the Gameworld.  The Combat,
Movement and Skills systems featured are like none other.  Progression in
the game is attainable by many routes other than tireless questing for
points.

The Age of the Throne website has recently had a professional makeover
and now boasts many useful pages and resources to help the newcomer to
quickly acclimatise into this unique gaming environment.

Age of the Throne employs a full time programmer allowing us to add new
features to the game on a weekly basis as well as promptly responding to
queries and bug reports.

posMUD offers a variety of unique experiences that cannot be found 
anywhere else.  
 * The staff codes and builds on a regular basis, improving the MUD 
and making it more enjoyable for the players; this is on top of an 
already mostly original, as well as large, world and class system. 
The staff and players are also friendly and willing to tend to new 
players' questions and concerns. 
 * Gone are the days of spending hours leveling; posMUD is based 
solely on PK and competition. All characters begin on the highest
mortal level, are given 3 newbie hours to practice their chosen 
class's skills and acquire basic equipment, and then are free to 
duke it out with other players as they see fit. The MUD is highly 
balanced, with a variety of different classes to choose from, each 
with distinct skills and spells, creating a unique experience each 
time you start a new character. 
 * Players can also join cabals, groups of players that work 
together for a cause, for protection, and are given special cabal-
restricted abilities. Cabals are headed by an leader chosen by 
proving their worth and responsibility, and are given many political 
privileges such as allegiances and war with other cabals.  
 * The world as it stands is quite large, with over 8000 rooms, over 
90 areas, and a plethora of items, equipments, and powerful non-
player opponents to vanquish. Certain items are limited to a 
preselected number to give players something to strive to acquire, 
whether it is from the item's original holder or another player.  
 * There are also rare rewards for superior players, such as useful 
quest skills and tattoos, symbols of immortals that grant players a 
powerful special ability.  
 All of these things blend together to give the posMUD a very 
unique, entertaining, and addictive feel, to the new and old player 
alike.

Alatia's vast world was a doorway, a doorway like none other. This doorway
was a gate to an infinite number of worlds and dimensions. Lands of

some of the surviving wizards. It has meanwhile been completely

Description :

AlexMUD is the oldest surviving DikuMUD, having passed its ninth birthday
in March 2000.  Because of its age, it may not appear to possess all of the
'features' of the newer MUDs. However, a revamped skill and spell system
very different to what might be found elsewhere, all add up to give us a
a certain uniqueness that will only be discovered once a player has started
his or her adventures.

AlexMUD has no levels. All skills are improved through use, while spells
can be increased by discovering more powerful versions of those that a
character may already possess. While roleplaying is not required, it is
strongly encouraged, for mortal actions have everlasting consequences...

'Many years have passed, and the kingdom has recovered from the destruction
of the 5th War and the high cost of the Dwarven Alliance, which has since
dissolved since the stoppage of payments. The Council of Ardenfall continues
to rule the kingdom, but many folk living outside the capital have begun to
mutter that the Council favours too much the people of that city, to the
detriment of the rest of Ardenia. Tensions have begun to rise, and the
outland nobility have become more vocal in their opposition.'

place for any sort of creature looking for somewhere to hang out a

builders since October, 1997, the grand opening to the public was on
January 1, 1998, and everyone is welcome to stop by and have a look.

Alfandria is a social MUCK by design, and inherits quite a bit from
its larger predecessors, including the Fuzzball server code and most
of the major publicly available MUF code.  Building, while not
unlimited, is not highly restricted, especially for areas of general
use to everyone on the MUCK.

universe of Dark Horse comics and 20th Century Fox fame.  We're

systems that offer new, dynamic gameplay, including equipment-based
classes!

AvP is a PK MUD with RP mixed in.  We feature clans, vehicles,
guns and ranged combat, explosives, racewars, and more!  You
won't find ANY stock mobs, objects, or rooms.  What you WILL find
is plenty of excitement to get your heart pumping, as you play a
heavily armed Colonial Marine, the stealthy Yaut (Predator), or a
lethal Alien.  The action is fast and furious, the event-driven
combat and unique skill engine add a new level to game play and
introduce new strategies, and the MOBs can distinguish friends
and enemies... even at a distance.

Remember: This Time It's War.

A recreation of Heart of the Empire in MUD format. This game offers
a classless system that lets you make a character the way you want, 
with no skill 'forbidden' for reasons untold. 

* A full crafting system allows players to create quality equipment

people.

told, puzzles to be deciphered, as well as the staple 
'Fetch me a Nail' ventures.
* Summoning system brings powerful spirit beings to your side to fight
alongside you, even gaining experience while they are there.

* Six countries of origin tweak your character in powerful ways,
allowing even two otherwise identical characters to be special and
unique.

* Runic Shards, mini enchantments you can find on monsters or even
make yourself allow for nigh infinite customization of gear by adding
abilities and powers to already existing equipment.

* Gain reputation by doing quests, getting better prices in towns that
know and respect you.

The game IS in testing, with more areas being added every day and new
features implemented under player request. Join this tale and make

   Almaren is a derivation of the ancient (and alas, dead)

killing monsters is, simply put, trivial, and that phase
of playing the game is to be taken merely to learn the MUD
in preparation for participating in quests and acquiring
better (limited!) equipment through PK.

There are 7 distinct classes.  Class lines are not now, and
never will be blurred by multiclassing or by sharing too
many skills.  Mages are mages, and Warriors are warriors.

Equipment exists in both random, and standard limited form.
This allows (and in fact, encourages) healthy PK to exist
to circulate item's such as the Goblin King's crystal shard,
and Miko's titanium ring.  Randomly created equipment is
well distributed throughout the world such that one is not
required to compete for the limiteds if desired.

Description :

  Ever wonder what a Pokemon MUSH would be like if it it were given a
more serious twist, and a theme to match?  If the adventures of Ash,
Gary, Misty and Brock weren't the typical formulaic plot over and 
over? If humans were more than bystanders, if the world was a bit more
realistic, and if Team Rocket was at war with the Pokemon trainers of 
the world, trying to enslave them and their hidden power?

At Pokemon Champions, a new roleplaying environment,
this is how it is.

A new MUSH that's trying to give a deeper look at the
possibilities of the Pokemon theme, we have a highly
sophisticated theme with a small, but mature playerbase.  
Taking the best elements from the anime, manga and games, 
and adding in plenty of our own take on it to deepen it, we've 
come up with a unique take on the entire theme that you won't find 
anywhere else.  Come pick up one of the numerous FCs, or 
create your own character - Pokemon or human - and either aid 
Professor Oak in his fight against the scourge of Team Rocket 
or join Giovanni in his attempt to take the hidden power of 
the trainers of the Kanto region, and with them fuel his bid for
world domination.  The possibilities are endless, and ultimately the 
choice is yours.

Take a look.  Hey, maybe the Pokemon theme seems tired and
silly, but really, if you're a mature RPer looking for
something different, or a fan of Pokemon who's even a little
intrigued, what could five minutes hurt?  Come visit us.

Description :

 Infinite Fear is a lighthearted, not-too-serious MUD that caters mainly
to more experienced Smaug players who are keen to relive the glory of
the old Realms of Despair days. In saying that it has many great
additions made to not only the code but the areas as well.
New players don't be alarmed, this place is VERY newbie friendly,
it's not hard to get a foothold like on some MUDs, where the first
few players get all the glory. It's just that it's been created to
be very attractive to a player who is disgruntled with the way Realms
of Despair has gone over the past 4 years. Hopefully this means it's
attractive to you also.

Infinite Fear is what I like to call a PK encouraged MUD, yes there is the
option to play as a peaceful and this works nicely too, but there are
worthwhile incentives to encourage you to play as a deadly as I believe
that player killing is an important part of the MUD gaming experience.

There is heaps to do, as I've amassed a massive collection of the highest
quality areas I could find and made them suit the MUD perfectly over
the years.

If you're looking for a quality MUD that has everything you need to
have a great playing experience (except maybe players at this point),
come take a look.

Limited time only: players will recieve a basic avatar set of equipment
for their first character to reach avatar. Also, 50 glory reward for
people who get their friends to play (and stay).

Plenty of chances to make an impact on this place!

on at a time, and rarely falling below 60 in the off hours.

In addition to the traditional pursuits of slaying monsters and
exploring the realm, we also run social games of Trivia, Stars,
Yahtzee, and Scavenger Hunts frequently.  Multiplayer Poker and
Chess can be enjoyed at any time.  In the library, players can
find a large and diverse range of reading material.

Ancient Anguish has a very rich environment, possessing a very
detailed and consistent World theme and living history.  Additions
to the game must adhere to strict 'describe all' standards so
that each room helps to immerse you in textual virtual reality.

Rather than bore you with our impressive race/class/guild/quest counts, 
we simply ask you to find out for yourself why we've been consistently
popular since early 1992, and are called home by thousands of players.

to join us. We offer roleplay in both the school itself
and the adult world, where the rise of the mysterious Dark
Lord, whose name must not be mentioned to power is taking
place. Dumbledore is Headmaster at Hogwarts, and Barty
Crouch is the head of the Department of Magical Law
Enforcement. Domert Ardoss and Jovan Gravely have been
brought to justice, but the Dark Mark is still making
itself known. Wizards and Witches are called forth to
protect the Wizarding World as they know it. The lure of
power, immortality, and promise of no longer needing to
hide from muggle eyes is seductively calling to those who
care to hear.

  Character generation is easy and there is no application
required for those who wish to play students or everyday 
adults. There are applications for rarer and more powerful 
characters, such as Aurors, Teachers, Animagi, Ministry 
Officials, Metamorphmagus, and of course, Dark Wizards.

We are without a doubt the OLDEST and LONGEST RUNNING 
Dragonlance Mud around.  Ansalon is a legacy thats been 
around since the time of The Keep, spanning more than 13 
years of the absolute LOVE of Dragonlance.  We are all about 
the roleplay, the storytelling, and keeping the magic of 
Krynn alive. 

Ansalon has the fortune of having an older average playerbase.
Teens are still encouraged and nurtured, but the majority of
our players are adults escaping from the real world for a 
little while each day.  Our staff is comprised of
professionals:  scientists, bankers, teachers, artists.

We fully encourage clans and nations.  Ansalon is one of the 
very few muds that new people can come in, carve out a nation 
for themselves and rise to leadership positions through simply 
the force of their roleplay. Many of our existing groups are 
looking for fresh blood as well. Our clerical system is one of 
the best found ANYWHERE.

If you have any comments or questions, feel free to email
us at ansalon@mudmagic.com  We'd love to hear from you.

(On a personal note, we have recently moved from wolfpaw to 
mudmagic because of security isuses.  This being said, we 
can be accessed from multiple ports.  If 8679 is down, try

Apocalypse V contains 64 fantasy zones for game play, over 40 of which

this MUD. Anybody can create a zone for Apoc, not just immortals. 

Apocalypse V currently has 11 races (Dwarf, Elf, Gnome, Half-elf,

2. Without an equal or equivalent; unparalleled. 

Many muds will claim to be unique or claim to have truly exciting and 
wondrous ideas only to let down the prospective players.  We are not one of 
those muds. We have been a stable, well respected mud for 8+ years and have 
even led the Mudconnector boards for a year and a half (for telnet and www 
hits).  Our two IMPs have a combined 31 years of mud design experience and 
can trace their mudding roots back to some of the original muds of the late
80s and early 90s.  If that is not enough to convince you to check us out, 
just go through our character creation and you will be hooked by the 
flexibility and wide array of paths a character can go down.  If you need 
help all you have to do is ask.  And if you don't want to ask, you can find
pretty much any information you are looking for on our extensive www site.  
We have polls for our players to use to decide on many aspects of gameplay 
which are then coded by our professional staff of immortals.  Other muds can
promise to be the best  out there but we don't deal in promises, we deal in 
results. Come check us out and see if we are as good as we say we are...

Description :

  RUMORS HAVE COME from the Celtic Forest, of new and strange things. Of Elves. A
strange and academic race of beings, taller and of fairer complexion than men,
and all of them of enchanting beauty, they come from lands unknown, and are
quite a mystery in and of themselves.

EVERY SHIELDMEET AT NOON, a party of five Elves emerge from the forest as well,
with wagons containing strange things valuable and mysterious. As the day
progresses, stranger and stranger things begin to happen. Gnomes and Giants
emerge from the mountains, though in peace. The giants offer steel tempered by
their strong arms while the gnomes bring small pieces of clockwork, the best
available. Satyrs bring the finest wine imaginable, and the Great Feast of
Shieldmeet ensues at dusk. In the morning, the first Cymri or Celt awakens to
find all the magical things departed, and the earth restored to as it was before
so many people trod on it.

It is now Midwinter AD 855.

Telnet      : mud.arctic.org 2700 [128.6.224.101]
WWW         : http://mud.arctic.org/
Description :

 Welcome to ArcticMUD, a multi-player fantasy
role-playing game based on the Dragonlance novels. 
The base code for the game was gamma Diku, which
has been modified extensively for over a decade
to provide a unique gaming experience.

If you are new to MUDs, Arctic is a text-based
adventure game where you create a persona and
adventure in a fantasy world. Arctic is set in
the world of Krynn, the basis for the
Dragonlance novels. You can explore the world of
Krynn -- combating dragons, ogres, draconians,
and countless other creatures, discovering rare
treasures, and finding hidden locations -- along
with hundreds of other players.

Arctic is geared towards a mature game-playing
audience. Character interactions are handled in
a realistic manner. Player-characters stealing
from and killing each other is not necessarily
encouraged, but it is allowed.

As the premier Dragonlance MUD, Arctic has
developed a rich environment that provides
countless hours of free enjoyment. Start playing
today and find out if you have what it takes to
join the adventure!

Telnet      : mud.areth.org 6000 [206.251.158.2]
WWW         : http://www.areth.org/
Description :

The universe of Areth is a dimensional eddy, a Sliders-esque parallel Earth
into which dimensional anomalies deposit beings from other worlds, times,
or even realities.  If you've never seen Great Dragons, Predators, Kzinti,
and Klingons slaying wizards protected by legions of acid-blooded Aliens,
play Areth and you will.

Game-wise, Areth's a fair and challenging game environment.  Immortals are
strictly forbidden to aid *any* mortal in gameplay, give out free equipment,
or level their friends.  Everything on Areth, except for the boost to level
2, is earned by the player's own innate skill on a level playing field.
This annoys twinks who schmooze their way to the top on other muds, but
we're not interested in them anyway.  On the other hand, players looking for
a fair, challenging game environment are well rewarded here.  We have 12
classes planned, 9 are currently available: Cleric, Mage, Paladin, Psion,
Rogue, Samurai, Ninja, Martial Artist, and Warrior. There are presently
over 300 functional skills/spells, and by the time the rest of the class
work is done there will most likely be around 450.

We're also looking for a few talented builders.  Talented means being
able to build using a text editor, not MZF or OLC.

Description :

  Millenia ago, the discovery of hyperspace travel brought the galaxy
together, giving birth to a democratic union of star systems known as 
the Galactic Republic. From the time of its inception, the Republic 
grew, over thousands of years, to encompass vast numbers of 
inhabitated worlds. The survival of the Republic depended on two 
factors: the wise governing of selfless administrators and 
lawmakers... and the preservation of harmony and justice by a heroic 
warrior fraternity - the Jedi Knights. In those glorious ancient 
days, a great many Force sensitive individuals willingly entered 
arduous training under accomplished Jedi Masters, taking up the
weapons, the knowledge, and the powers of the Jedi Way. Yet... Upon 
the horizon dwells those who would unravel all which the Republic has 
laboured so hard to accomplish, those who possess a twisted, rage-
fuelled version of the Force. Those who fall under a solitary name, a 
name to strike terror into the heart of the civilised galaxy. That 
name, is the Sith...

Description :

  Life on the desert planet of Zalanthas is a daily struggle 
to survive. In Allanak, a city full of conniving 
merchants, ruthless, thieving elves, cut-throat 
mercenaries, and shadowy assassins, the brutal sandstorms 
are the least of your worries. In recently freed Tuluk, 
where the Sorcerer-King Muk Utep rules, former rebels work 
to rebuild their fallen city. Meanwhile, Luirs' Outpost, 
poised between the two, struggles with the clash of opposing 
forces, bandit and gith incursions, and the 
latest invasion of mantis. 

Over a decade old, award-winning Armageddon MUD is as addictive 
for its harsh desert theme as it is for its beautifully written 
environment, revolutionary programming, and intense, required 
roleplay. Players describe it as 'the most creative, emotionally 
involved game on the net,' 'as convoluted as an X-Files episode,' 
and 'as much a work of art as a game.' Real-time 
interaction with multiple players around the world will 
draw you into this world and offer you a gaming experience you 
will never forget.

Dungeon Master would run it - fun, intriguing, playable, 
and full of adventure. Storylines (quests alone are not
enough) that run through the local characters (NPC or 
otherwise) are the focus, as well as forging the future of 
the mud in the present with the players. Creators in our 
opinion are there for the users and the game, not to 
promote themselves, their egos, or their positions. The 
dedicated staff strive to balance realism with playability, 
while listening to the suggestions of our most valuable asset - 
the playerbase.

 In October of 2001, the Visitor Motherships arrived over the cities of
Earth, 50 in all. They claimed to have arrived intending peace, but they
lied. They came to take us prisioner and to rob the planet of the resources.
By the end of Novemeber, they controlled the planet. Lucky for the Earth, a
Resistance was able to form, and beat them with the Red Dust.%R After a full
year, they came back, as the Dust wasn't completely effective, and now, can
not be released again for enviornmental and Health reasons. The warmer
regions are back under Visitor Control, all except LA, thanks to a deal
brokered between the Visitors and Science Frontiers, who has taken over the
LA Government. That was 6 months ago. Now the Resistance is in hiding, for
the most part, looking for a way to cause the Visitors troubles.

and your alignment starts to fall towards evil, your God will look 
on you with ill favor, causing you to perform poorly. However, if 
you keep your alignment in favor with your God, then you will 
perform better.

  AstroMUD is a place of dreams.  Silly, serious or even

you be good or evil?  Will you walk in the night with
the undead or feel the sunlight on your face?
  
 AstroMUD's creation happened in a remote section of the
universe, in a relatively small galactic cluster, a medium
size mass of matter came together to form a planetary
body. Thus AstroMUD was born. 

 Astro Scholars have long blamed the lack of true rules in
the universe on this statistical improbability. However
others believe that the universe simply needed a place to
put 'stuff' it couldn't explain, but was probable.  

  AstroMUD is old in mud years and has more to offer than
we could ever hope to explain here. We offer you an 
invitation to visit one of the most addictive games on
earth.

Mud         : AugMUD
Code Base   : [Circlemud] Heavily Modified CircleMUD 2.20
Telnet      : augmud.ca 4000
WWW         : http://www.augmud.ca/
Description :

  In the beginning all was chaos; in the end all was not order, but
rather chaos with a healthy amount of order. Out of this grew a
world friendly to all Mudders whether they are Newbies or not. 
This in turn fueled the need for an extensive social system; one
in which a Mudder, such as yourself, can come relax, chat with
fellow Mudders, and catch up on the latest gossip from the land.
Or, if you prefer you can mount some form of beast and set off to 
new and exciting lands, or familiar lands, and track down those
despicable creatures which attempt to turn the world into pure 
chaos or pure order. Along the way one might set off on a quest to
find various things, rescue someone in distress, or to stop a war
from even beginning. Whatever your preference there is always 
something jumping out to catch your curiosity and fuel your drive
to be the best. For example, perhaps you begin as a Warrior and 
decide that this is not how you want to spend your days so you 
take up the holy life of a Cleric; however, much to your dismay 
you don't feel driven by the life a Cleric leads  so you begin to
study the arts of thievery and discover that this is indeed your
true calling. The skills one can  develop on a path such as this
are extensive, providing you look further than your Guildmaster,
and useful in all areas of life. Whatever your path may be the
land of Aug has something to offer you if you are willing to look
beyond what meets the eye.

WWW         : http://aurora.imaginary.com:3080/
Description :

   At first glance, it would seem that Aurora is a planet like
any other. There is more to it than meets the eye, however,
one of its mysteries being the fact that the naked, noisy
bipeds who settled all over its surface do not even suspect
that 'their' world is in fact run by an ancient feathered
race who rarely leave their hiding places, and even if they
do, few people are able to distinguish them from other
living creatures... The humanoids do not even suspect that
they themselves mostly came from a world distant in time and
space from the planet they currently inhabit, quite by
accident...

If you dare, visit Aurora to discover its many secrets and
face the dangers that await the unwary travellers treading
its paths...

The official language of the game is English, but because
it's located in Spain (and was in fact the first MUD there),
there is also an optional channel for those who would like
to exercise their (sometimes too colloquial! :) Spanish.

* Be sure to check out port 4000 for a glimpse of what *

Description :

      Since 1991 AustinMUD has been a constantly evolving alternative to
the powermuds where the only thing people care about is how to reach 
the  highest level in the shortest period of time.   This is a world where 
you can immerse yourself in roleplay and exploration for a very long time.

      Once you create a character of one of several races, you enter an 
internally consistent world made up of nearly 8000 unique rooms, which 
takes a long time to explore it fully.  The world is filled with built-in 
quests, interactive special effects, and mobs that behave differently 
according to their race.  All this means you will have to think, not just 
type, when you roam the world.

      But the real secret of Austin is the players and dedicated immortals 
who make the game an interesting and lively virtual world.  This is a mud 
where you will meet intelligent and interesting players and interact with 
them in immortal-run quests, player-managed guilds, optional 
playerkilling, and shared adventures. 

      If you decide to play Austin you will know for sure that you will
quit on the game before the game quits on you.

Telnet      : sanitysedge.com 2020 [64.165.56.211]
WWW         : http://sanitysedge.com/
Description :

  Sanity's Edge is a cyberpunk genre mud set in the decaying 
center of Edge City. Two sides of life are vividly depicted, 
the rich, opulent  life of the corporations and the wretched 
squallor of the street.

  The year is 2026 and local  politics have been effectively 
controlled  by  the  corporations,  led  by  the  dominating 
Cybernetic  Matrix  Designs corporation.  The glittering CMD 
building looms  brightly at the center of downtown,  but not 
far away  the  seedier  aspects of  life  hide  in  run-down 
apartment buildings and shadowy alleyways.

  Street gangs  stake out territory,  and are always looking 
for more cannon fodder like  you  to join their ranks.  Just
remember, it's a war out there,  and you never know when you 
might get caught in the crossfire.

  Crime is on the rise,  and  netrunners are the wave of the 
future, becoming the backbone of the crime scene  with their 
intimate knowledge of the Net.

  Safety  has  become  a  thing  of  the past;  you may find
yourself assaulted  by a street kid with a switchblade or an
irate shopowner with a sawed-off shotgun.  But with a little 
luck and some smarts, you might fight your way to the top -- 
even  into  a  corporate job.  And then you'll only have one 
thing  to  worry  about,  your  CredCard -- never leave home 
without it.

the dragons that threaten to destroy the town and all within 
its walls. If it is the path of nobility and honour that you 
choose to follow, you will find many who will teach you and 
advise you, and if it is the path of the cunning and 
deceptive that you prefer, you too will find others ready to 
show you craftier ways, though you may have to walk the back 
alleyways to find such folk.

WWW         : http://www.mudhost.com/badlands/
Description :

- The entire fight system has been changed to a more
realistic, easy to understand system. Hits are limb based 
and damage is determined by what eq worn on that limb. So if
hit for 10 dam in chest and you have on 3 absorb chest eq, 7
dam is taken. Chance of hitting is based on eq weight vs
statistics. The ligher eq is the better.

- No saving throw system, it has been ripped out and 
replaced by a much easier system to use and understand.

- The world and its descriptions have been set carefully and
all links have been smoothed and flow seemlessly.

- A class specialization system which allows you to re-class
each 25 levels, selections depending on previous classes.
Allowing a total of 18 classes 76 possible combinations.

- All mobs have a race and class balancing the mud nicely.
Hard mobs here aren't just loaded with affects like sanct.
So if fighting a mage it casts correct mage spells on its
own, or if fighting a dragon it actually uses dragon 
techniques. Also, each race has their own resistances and
vulnerabilities, so an idea is undead take more damage from
fire attacks and fish are more succeptable to lightning.

DragonBall GT was not created by Toriyama, but is still 
just as popular as the original shows and mangas.

DragonBall Infinity offers several of the things seen 
in the popular series. Races such as Saiyans, Nameks, 
Bio-Androids, Androids, even Ghettis; and more races 
are still in the works. Skills and abilities such as 
Super Saiyan, the Kamehameha wave, Kaioken Attack, and 
much more features bring the series straight to your 
computer.

We feature an exclusive RolePlay storyline, derived 
from the series themselves. RolePlay is highly 
encouraged, with new plot twists forming every day.

Description :

  Eleuthria is guaranteed to be unlike any MUD you've played
before.  The theme in Eleuthria is Tactical RPGs.  Many people
have played these, and examples include: Shining Force, Fire 
Emblem, Tactics Ogre, Final Fantasy Tactics, and Kartia.

However, instead of fighting against a pre-programmed AI, the
game pits real people against each other, as a true test of 
the mind.  With many classes available, completely customized 
stat gains at each level, and a diverse spell system, you'll 
find limitless possibilities.  No combination could ever be 
'the best' in Eleuthria.

The game is not simply a clone of ideas from these, but an 
entire MUD with a tactical RPG engine.  Through the use of 
ANSI foreground and background colors, players can see 
hand-designed maps drawn in ASCII characters, creating a look
and feel to the game.  This is followed with a 'menu-esque' 
system, where commands take you into different modes, where 
each command is prompted to you, with your input refreshing 
the current task.

If you are a fan of tactical RPGs, you would be wise to look
at Eleuthria!

BatMUD has given birth to many clones, including two sibling
sites: BatMUD classic (BatMUD as it was in 1994) and HardCore 
BatMUD (fast powerplay with permanent deaths). However, the 
original remains among the largest and most feature-rich 
LPMUDs on the Internet.

Mud         : Mystic Legends

Telnet      : ml.mudhost.com 2001 [216.195.183.4]
WWW         : http://ml.mudhost.com
Description :

  Mystic Legends is an ongoing project based upon the TFE 
codebase but not the TFE world. ML provides a medieval 
setting where all the areas and world designs are original -
none of the areas belong to any other creators on other 
muds.

Currently, Mystic Legends is looking for seasoned writers 
to help add to the adventuring world and possibly to help 
shape some of the land's races. ML offers many
features which are both enticing to players and creators, 
some of which include multi-part quests, talking mobs, 
socials based upon race, and a large range of 
individualized spells. Eventually, as time permits and as we
get further into adding and modifying the TFE codebase, 
here will be 14 classes, included a few rarer ones like 
alchemists and runecasters and somewhere in the 
neighborhood of 17 races - from the familiar, like dwarves 
and elves, to the less frequent centaurs, minotaurs, and a 
race of cat people (Felkarans).

Mystic Legends is happy to announce that it opened in early 
November 2002, and awaits those who want a taste of the 
familiar with a fresh new world to explore.

Description :

   FASA's Battletech board game is a turn based simulation of future combat.
Battletech MUX has adapted this system into a realtime environment.  In
the battlefield of the future, the weapon of choice is the battlemech.
'Mechs are 10 meter tall machines that are vaguely humanoid in appearance.
These fusion-powered mammoths mount a devastating array of weapons and
massive armor.  Players join a faction (team) and the factions compete
against each other for control of a world.  The simulation runs 24
hours/day 7 days/week.  The battletech universe is a complex one, far too
complex to fully describe here.  Roleplaying opportunities are huge but
roleplaying is not required.  For something totally different, try
Battletech MUX.

Most important to note is that this is not a 'sim'

not the system.  See our web site for more timely

Description :

  The lands of TLD form an intricate world emerging from
ruin. As a player, your initial objective is to advance
through the realm's academies, but after that the
possibilities are endless. Form clans, kingdoms, or even an
empire. Conquer areas that are integrated with the world
and where wit and strategy are rewarded through many
puzzles, builder-defined quests, and much more! The lands
are full of surprises and unexpected twists. The major
difference between this MUD and many others i've been to
is that players will earn most EXP points from clearing an
entire area, either by conquest or solving all quests and
puzzles... not limited to 'hack-and-slash' methods. Those
interested in building will find a heavily extended array
of tools and toys that make it easy to create a rich and
elaborate area that offers so much more than just random
killing... without the use of a single mob-program!

Description :

...It was foretold in the Chronicles of Qod, a millenia or
more ago in the Second War of Shadoe. The ascension of Agog, 
the Epoch of Transformation, and the redirection of 
mortality...

The last vestiges of the imperial wars, with Ryadel's failed 
attempt, and the concurrent fall of Thalos left the great 
powers scattered and bathed the lands yet tamed once again 
into shadow. At this crucial juncture did the Herald of 
Walutzu appear to Incubus, proclaiming the new order, and the 
city of Korflu rose in its course, forever scarred, but 
blessed with great resources.

From this city rise the great adventurers, the legend-makers 
of Keilar. Born of a kindred spirit, they journey out and tame 
the wild places, and what was once forgotten has been 
rediscovered. These are the heroes of the Forbidden Lands!

the Blue Face Inn, touching gently upon the polished tables
and cluttered memorabilia.  A few of the boys were sitting at
the bar, listening to the agitated stranger.  Morgan was
polishing mugs and watching quietly.

     'What really gets me,' said the stranger, taking another
grateful gulp of beer, 'is the way that the sun seems almost
to pause at sunset, before sinking below the horizon.'
There was a pause.  Nobody seemed to know what to say. 

     'I mean,' said the stranger hesitantly, looking around
at his mute audience, 'why should it seem to do that, huh?'

     Finally Thioron spoke up, speaking slowly as if to a
child.  'Well... the sun pauses before permitting night, to
watch for his old nemesis, the moon.' He seemed puzzled at
the stranger's ignorance.  'Once in a while, of course, it
will return for a few hours.  I remember back when I was a
child, they even fought once.'

     There was a long pause.  The man looked up from his
beer, staring open-mouthed at Thioron.

     'You're not from around here, are you?' asked Morgan.

WWW         : http://come.to/CajunNights/
Description :

   The World of Darkness is very similar to our own. Same
cities, same movies, same events all exist there, just as
they do in the real world. However, there are many 
differences. Corruption is rampant, apathy and ignorance 
have taken the general populace and the Supernatural walk 
the earth, hiding themselves just beyond the perception of 
the mundanes. The creatures have been influencing the 
course of the world since the beginning, all the while 
waging an eternal war between themselves. Few have realized 
the source of the dacay and darkness that surrounds them.

   Cajun Nights supports Mortals, Kindred, Garou, Magi, 
Mortal+, Wyrm, Voodoun, and a host of others. No Fae or 
Wraiths though. The MUSH has active, excellent staffers, a 
large player base, and some of the best coding around. Old 
and new players are welcome. Atmosphere is everything.

   Cajun Nights has been running for 7 years, and has been 
under the same management for 5 of those years. (2 Years 
were dedicated to mush/world development)

Description :

   In the beginning, there was reality....  Then we trashed that whole
idea and went with chaos and lunacy instead.  We felt it would be more fun
that way.
 
   On the first day, we created an account system to keep players more
organized...  And it was good.  On the second day, we created a new kind
of auction system, never seen before in MUDs.  And it was good.
 
   On the third day, we created speedwalk and multi-commands... And it was
good, but the players wanted more!  So, on the fourth day, we created
clans so that players could congregate.
 
   On the fifth day, we did away with PK... And the morts stopped killing
each other.
 
   On the sixth day, we made the mobs come to life so the world was not so
dreary and boring.
 
   On the seventh day, we thought players should have a lot of fun with
Quests, so we created ways to let Immortals run quests a lot easier...
 
   On the eighth day, we gave the world a face-lift and it looked new.
 
   And then, on the ninth day (yes, we have nine, you'll get used to it)
we added a lot more...  Then we slept for about 40 hours straight.  And we
spoke the words, and you came forth to multiply...  And kill mobs.

    We are also one of the muds which people try to

Elf, Dark-Elf, Wood-elf, Surface Gnome, Deep Gnome, Dwarf,
Duergar, Felar, Arial, Lich, Orc, Minotaur, Fire Giant,
Storm Giant, and Cloud Giant. Varied classes (each with
vast numbers of unique skills/spells): Necromancer,
Transmuter, Invoker, Conjurer, Warrior, Thief, Shaman,
Healer, Druid, Paladin, Anti-Paladin, Assassin, Ranger,
Berserker, Shapeshifter, and Bard.  Warriors specialize in
a weapon.  Mages undergo transformation at high levels. A
large world: 250+ areas (~23000 rooms), all original to
CF.  Also, an 11 area collection forming Hell (based on
Inferno), and several puzzle/quest based 'exploration
areas'.  Object limits that fluctuate according to the
player base. Extensive help files (1400+) both in the game,
during character creation, and on our web page if you want
to read them safely.  Player Killing for levels 11+ and
based on experience points gained.  Age is finite (you can
die of old age).  Guilds are raidable.  Characters have two
hands (sounds simple, but most MUDs neglect this). Special
Programs for objects, mobiles, and built-in quests. A
system of religion where Immortals tattoo their followers
and empower priests.  9 Cabals to join for protection and
power; another cabal for storytelling. We have been open to
the public for over nine years and have a good player base
(average about 75).

     Champions MUSH is an online version of the role-playing game
  Champions, created by Hero Games. (http://www.herogames.com/)
We are now using the 4th Edition Rules for conflict resolution
(combat, contests of skill, etc.). 

     We are set in the city of Colonial Bay, Virginia, USA. The
time is the future, the year 2054. Superheroes fly the skies and
patrol the city in search of crime to stop and villains to put
behind bars. In their spare time, they get to know each other and
are able to form teams to combat the villains that plot more
havoc each day.  We have solo heroes as well as team heroes. 


  Champions MUSH relies on plots created and run both by the
players and the MUSH's GameMasters (GMs). We allow players to 
play heroes or villains. Each player is allowed two characters 
maximum.
  Champions MUSH is diverse in its characters and type of play.
     
  Please come and take a look around at this small and friendly
MUSH. The system is complicated but loved and cherished by many
in table top games. This is a game that requires great patience
and skill. Great rewards to those who come and try.

Description :

From Barbarians, to the mental warrior Reaver you will have no
problem finding a class to suit your fancy. The races also give you 
an extra spice as the blood of a vampire runs hot in the middle of 
the night and the demons cause a great blight to cover the land. The 
Angels rejoice with heaven’s charge and grow in their heavenly union
to create a bond of strength with their deity. However in Chaos, all 
is never what it seems and the realms never stay the same. The land 
always has a new monster to fight or a new hero to announce. It is 
all created and lost through Chaos. 

Chaos is a heavily modified Merc code that was created for a fully 
customized Fantasy world. We offer lots of original areas with mob 
Interaction and mob-run quests, as well as a few of the Generic areas 
(customized) and an intricate system of roads, Rivers, etc. We have 
16 races, offer clans with clan rooms and associated bonuses, and a 
myriad other custom features.
 
Chaos has 500 player levels where you play the first 100 levels in 
one of 6 main classes. Then at level 100 players must choose between
three different specializations of their class with each 
specialization having a unique skill set with their own weaknesses 
and strengths. There is a damager, utility, and tank specialization 
for each of the six main classes. After Level 500, there are the 
LEGEND levels, with their own unique skills and equipment. 

If you would like to wield a legendary Chaos weapon and acquire 
special orbs through quests to increase your weapon's power, if you
want to slay potent enemies with spells like Were-dragon, Force 
Spikes, Ultimo, Assassinate, Midnight Blast, Dragon Strike, Swirling
Blades, Whirlwind etc, or travel through the world with an Energy 
Vortex or on a Ghostly Steed, then Chaos is the place for you. We 
hope to see you there!

 The Cities Of M'Dhoria is an enforced role-playing experience set in a 
fantasy, medieval-type society. Join in the story and establish yourself 
in a completely original world filled with magic, art, and destiny. One 
can join an army, be hired as a mercenary, or become a skilled artisan 
bent on spreading their craft and creativity throughout the nations while 
serving under or as part of a monarchy. Join an evil organization where a 
roguish lifestyle combines the art of trickery and stealth with greed and 
ambition in plots to rule. Spend your days as a noble knight or priest, 
spending your life spreading the message, blessings and wrath of your god. 
Conjure up magics, fight alongside your allies in battle, and create a 
place for yourself in society. In a moment, you can be swept into an 
unknown world where friends are made and enemies are destroyed in the 
blink of an eye, and where almost nothing is exactly as it seems. 

With unique magic and skill-based leveling systems, 16 classes and 19 
races to choose from, and innumerable storylines and plots, logical and 
roleplayed player-killing, and multiple continents to explore, CoM has 
something to offer for almost every type of roleplayer.

Description :

  In the not too distant future, war will be our end.  Predicted
by the intelligent for years in advance, nuclear warfare laid
mankind to rest.  The government is in shambles, we thought
this would be our last salvation.  

Let the warheads fly... 

Now, the sickening smell of death fills the air as the ashes of
radioactivity fall to the blood-soaked ground.  We gave 
democracy a chance.  It didn't work.  Our new government shall
be violence; Kill what you want, take what you need.  From the
Fallout of our end rose a new breed of warrior: a warrior 
without mind of peace, a warrior without mind of companionship.
We the People ... what a joke.

Fallout is not your average mud.  It requires an above-average
player.  We are a step away from the normal hack-and-slash
medieval fantasy MUDs.  Guns, bombs, cybernetic implants, 
computers, challenging levels, and totally original zones are
only a few of the features Fallout has to offer.  Leveling is a
difficult process that will most likely involve grouping with 
other players when you reach high levels.  

Only the strong survive, and the weak shall perish.  

Do you have what it takes?

   The theme of Columbus Twilight could be summed up
with a picture of a person standing on the edge of a
skyscraper, preparing to jump off, wearing designer
jeans, a $500 shirt and rag-tag tennis shoes.  The
whole world is on the brink of destruction.  Whether
you call it the Final Nights, the Apocalypse,
Oblivion, Ascention, it's here, and its real, though
most refuse to admit it. Columbus itself is a
growing city, hidden away from the rest of the
country despite its pleas for attention.  Sometimes
called 'the biggest little city on Earth', Columbus
is at the heart of the state that's 'at the heart of
it all'.  Away from the prying eyes of the nation
Columbus has begun to fester and boil over with
corruption and graft, yet there's a wholesome,
sugary topping to it all. Based on the World of
Darkness, Columbus Twilight dares to delve into the
darkest horrors of humanity while being grounded in
one of the most ordinary, non-threatening places on
earth.

Description :

   This was then: There was world ruled by a generous king who was kind to all of his
people. But amidst the dark corridors of the king's castle evil lurked. The king's magician
had vicious plans to take over and rule with darkness at his side.. he opened a portal to
the underworld.  An army of dark minions swirled out thrue the portal and into the peaceful
kingdom. But the dark forces were treacherous and betrayed the magician.

   The kingdom was swiftly overthrown, many people were killed and tortured. People fled
and sought shelter, they gathered in small tribes and soon found that the only place where
they could be safe from these evil forces was underground. They started building underground
complexes, magically hiding the entrances from the dreaded army above..

   Evil ruled the surface for many, many years. Man lost count of how long they had been
underground and the surface was soon but a legend of old times.

 This is now: As time went by and evil ravaged the surface, the climate started to
change.The surface started to become a dark and desolate place, haunted by cold winds. Evil
slowly retreated and eventually light came back to the kingdom. But the climate never
changed back and the kingdom will never be the same again. With the return of light man
began to open their well-covered hatches from below and take a glimpse of the outside world.
Seeing little danger, young and brave adventurers soon started to explore the surroundings.

 You are one of those adventurers and it is your task to give Bards of the future
something to sing heroic songs about around campfires once again.

 Soon you will be able to join an entirely new guild!

that are now on the same MUSH but in separate universes (thanks to HSPACE).
Cross-universe events are planned to occur, however, this joining has given both

WWW         : http://www.cshadow.net/
Description :

The Creator's Shadow is based on Diku/Rom code, but has been modified well
beyond what it originally was. TCS is a Role-playing game that is based on
the 'Wheel of Time' series of books, by Robert Jordan. We offer WoT races
and classes, the channeling system has been rewritten so that spells can be
sustained, tied, and inverted.  Channeling has also been shifted from a
'mana' based system to one based on RJ's 5 spheres of the True Source.  
Blademaster has been implemented, as well as 'speardancer' for Aiel. We have
an 'overland map' of the world, designed to link areas as they were linked     
in RJ's world. No longer a 'MUD', but neither is it a 'MUSH', we feel that
gaming should be more rp based instead of the random pking you find on other
muds and have adapted the code to encourage good rp. Although pking still 
plays a part in TCS it is not a must. Classes are carefully balanced to
allow players exellent playability in all classes. Our code makes better use
of skills and emphasizes less on actuall level. The actual code is quite
stable and we have dedicated coders able to fix bugs when found. We have   
gotten quite a few compliments, and are progressing nicely. The players and
immortals are quite friendly and helpful, and I hope you'll come visit us
soon.

WWW         : None
Description :

  It's hard to pin down one main thing that makes Spark stand
out. I'd say our main difference is our approach. We don't just
want to be a cool MUD, we want to be a fun GAME.

  Our builders are encouraged to think beyond what one normally
sees in a MUD and let their imagination be their guide, and let
me tell you, there's some really cool stuff. Mobs are capable of
interacting with players on a level unseen before on a MUD - like
a puppy you can buy at a pet shop that you can train to do
tricks. Even rooms can interact with players - a door knocker
that requires a riddle to be answered before a player may enter
the door - and the riddle isn't the same every time.

  Our 'Let's see what this thing can really do' approach is the
difference.

   This is my firt attempt at going public with a mud, so I'm
not sure what to say. This mud has been around for about 2
months, as of 8/16/99 we are open for the public. Cryptal 
Abyss is based on SMAUG, so it has a few areas from Realms 
of Dispair, but most of the areas are custom. We will be 
adding new races and classes soon. Once you reach level 50,
you may be able to become an immortal. There is layerable
equipment, which means that you can wear many pieces of eq
at once, in the same location. Before connecting, you will
need to go to the webpage to get the current IP. Directions
on how to change the IP is on the webpage. You don't have to
come to this mud, but if you want to, you're welcome to it!

Telnet      : portent.genesismuds.com 1299 [216.136.9.8]
WWW         : None
Description :

  The most ancient of elves speak of a time long ago when there were no 
humans walking the lands we know of today.  Nature and magic had reached
a balance in this time of legend until the day the elves call 'Esz'tinia',
or The Great Storm.  During The Great Storm an elf mage called Alkyone 
found solace for many beneath the waves where an heretofore unknown deity 
took pity on them and gave them a new life in the deep sea.

  The Great Storm, which consisted not of rain and wind but fire and 
lightning raged over the world for many years.  The mighty dwarves from 
the hills and mountains had taken safety along with their gnome brethren
in the deepest of their mines.

  When The Great Storm subsided those long years later and the races of 
the world crawled back onto the surface they found many changes.  Men 
had begun to arrive, having fled lands now buried beneath unknown waters.  
What followed then were minor battles as man, elf, dwarf, and gnome 
redrew the boundaries of old. 

  Then came the dragons.  Tiny pockets of hell cruising through the 
skies. Mostly humans roam the surface now, brought together into small 
pockets far from any dragon's lair.  The men unite under one deity with 
warriors and templars serving as defenders of the people.  Others seek to
restore balance with the elements, others feed upon the chaos, and 
others create it as they wield magics never before seen upon the world.

 Yes, this is really Armageddon MUSH's Mud Connector Listing. If you've found this 
listing you're likely an old playing wondering, 'What happened?' Basically, palemoon.net 
died, and it was a couple months by the time we found a new server. Then we found out we 
couldn't get Rhost again, so we needed to manually port over the old DB. And it was in 
this stage teh MUSH languished for many a'month. Now, however, Talisein is pushing to 
finish everything up and open around August 03. We'd appreciate your help and/or support.

Now, if you're a new player just finding this listing.. Well, Armageddon MUSH has a 
really great theme, crafted in '96 by Taisch. It's the End of the World Biblical style. 
The plagues and wars have come and past, and now Angels and Demons walk the streets of 
the Last City, clamoring for the last few Unchosen souls. Its pretty entertaining, yup. 
So log on, create a character, and tell the Staffers to move their butts 'cuz you want

remorting.  The Merchant code is nearly done, giving you a class that does not

WWW         : http://denver.darkalliance.org
Description :

     It's than a decade into the twenty-first century and the name   
'Denver, Colorado' still conjures up images of cowboys and pristine   
mountains. Called the 'Mile High City', Denver is the gateway to the  
Rocky Mountains, and is home to health food fanatics and ski bunnies. 
Despite what the brochures say, the truth is that Denver suffers from 
the same problems as other cities. Plagued by drugs, gang warfare, and
murder, Denver's darker side lies hidden beneath a carefully crafted  
image of suntanned athletes and Old West mystique. Industry is        
relegated to low income areas that are rarely frequented by tourists. 
Due to clerical errors, innocent people are killed in their own homes 
by the police officers sworn to protect them. Minorities of all       
stripes are victims of harassment brought on by racial profiling. News
reports of drive-by shootings and hate crimes are buried on page      
fifteen of the local papers, while stories about the Broncos take up  
the front page.                                                       
     Behind the carefully crafted mask and hidden below the concealed 
blemishes of the city lies something else: a hidden, secret soul.     
Local politics and industry are manipulated by blood drinkers; and the
forests are populated by monstrous half-animals. Willworkers bend     
reality, hiding their actions in parlor tricks. Physics and sorcerers 
work in secret societies, while fairies hide themselves in plain      
sight. Criminals are both predator and prey, targeted by these strange
beings, yet themselves targeting those who are innocent - and ignorant
- of the hidden city.
     Interested in a classic multi-sphere World of Darkness game?     
Looking for some fun RP in an interesting setting with good           
roleplayers and staff that cares? Want a chance to participate in     
plots and pursue personal growth? Then give Denver by Night a try.    
We're set in Denver Colorado in the year 2011. We feature the         
following spheres: Mortal Mortal+ Shifter Changeling and Mage. Our    
staff is a dedicated group of gamers who are veterans of not only     
online gaming but tabletop as well. Want to hear more? Feel free to   
log on to Denver at any time. There is almost always someone around to
help out, and if all else fails each sphere has an information room
available for unapproved players.

and boasts one of the most advanced and original codebases in
recent years.  The mud is based on the anime Cowboy Bebop, and
Bebop ONLY.  No Dragonball Z, pokemon, etc.  It is a project of
creating an immersive RP atmosphere combined with cutting edge
code and player interaction.

The mud showcases top notch building and coding talents, and has
been continuously worked on by a dedicated staff since its
creation.  It has instated many new systems for added realism,
including the 'living stat code,' making you have to work to
keep those stats up, redone space flight and combat, and a non-
automated combat system.

The mud has a good sized, and very dedicated playerbase, most
of which love the game to no end, as you can see from our
reviews.  This game is the perfect choice for anyone who is a

play a human character in a world comparable to ours, in which
you can help develop its society. It's all about 'reinventing'
politics, economics and other societal institutions. Just have a

   Darker Realms opened in 1990 and is quite possibly the
oldest still-running LP style mud in the USA.  DR was the
first mud to offer quest-based advancement, and still
maintains a large number of challenging and interesting
quests.  Although a number of guilds have cropped up, DR
is still based on the traditional LP mudlib. Ergo, it lends
a classic feel to what we believe is a classic game. There
are about 600 active players, but rarely more than 25 or so
on at a time.  DR has almost never been down for more than
a weekend, and recently moved to a much faster machine, so
it probably *isn't* the slowest LP in existance anymore :)

Description :

Five hundred years ago an asteroid crashed into the Northern 
Hemisphere of our world and while not a pure planet killer it 
caused enough damage to threaten all. Those who weren't cause 
in the initial fires, shakes, eruptions, or floods felt a 
longer strain as the climate cooled, and the icy poles began 
to spread. Species large and small were disturbed from the 
previous balance, and inevitably conflicts began.

The Reskai, a cross of reptile and avian, was too forced to 
seek new territories as its old migration and breeding lands 
were destroyed, and so the Menace came into conflict with the 
humans and dragons. Thus, a bargain was struck between the 
telepathic dragons and the humans of this world. The humans 
would care for the children of dragon-kind, and the dragons 
would help the humans to fight the invasion of the Reskai.

WWW         : http://perils-awakening.wolfpaw.net
Description :

In the beginning there was but a single entity, who called itself 
Oere, meaning 'The One'.  For time beyond eternity it existed in a 
state of introspection, pondering its existence and who it was.  
Finally the day came where it knew it could only define its 
existence by comparing it to something else.  And so it divided 
itself, almost infinitely, in one incredible flash of energy.  From
the pieces was created matter, which eventually formed planets.  It 
is the planet of Eltheria that we focus upon now.

Eltheria gave birth to a single intelligent life form.  A race 
called the Saedar.  The Saedar were masters of intellect.  A serpent-
like race with scaly, ebony skin, they had passed through many, many 
ages, from a primitive superstitious beginning, to war-like empires, 
to vast industrialized nations, until they reaced their first peak, 
upon which their destructive technology nearly abolished the 
planet.  In the wake of the first cataclysm, the Saedar cast off 
their technological background and instead focused on the spiritual 
again.  For tens of thousands of years they lived simple lives, 
until they soon became in-tune with their inner being, their own 
personal part of Oere.  It is at this point that the miracles of 
magic were discovered.  But history was doomed to repeat itself.  
Massive magical empires were created until again, their arrogance 
and pride defeated themselves, this time shocking the planet with 
waves of transformational spell-weaves.

It is here that we awake, a mere one hundred years after the second 
cataclysm.  The magical shockwaves having transformed the physical 
form of nearly all the Saedar into something new, something 
different.  Animals gained intelligence and humanoid form.  New 
kingdoms were created.  The handful of Saedar who survived were 
elevated to an almost god-like status, worshipped by the lesser 
races, and sought after by many a disciple seeking the answers of 
the past.  But a dark mystery lurks beneath the surface of the 
earth, and strife is everywhere in this post-apocalyptic world.  For 
it is the dawn of a new age... and all must awake to it!

Description :

   The Great War of the Mages, the Arcanix, nearly destroyed the 
world, and all man's glorious works.  The Protectors of Life managed 
to defeat the Lords of Chaos, and lock them out of the Realm.  But 
now, several centuries later, the magic of the seals has been 
weakened.  One of the Evil Lords has managed to cross the boundaries 
between the Planes, and seeks to revive the Arcanix.  Only a single 
Protector stands against him.  He desperately seeks aid for his 
beleaguered world, and has sent out his call across the multiverse.  
Even though the call was meant for aid, the Evil Lord has managed to 
slip some of his evil minions through the gate, and so the battle 
rages on.

The forces of Chaos have found a strong foothold, and it is feared 
that once again the world stands at the Dawn of Demise.

Dawn of Demise implements many new features and ideas not seen in 
other muds.  A small list of our unique features include:

* Advancement to level 100 and dual classing.
* Pets save and level like player characters.
* A unique automated quest system that offers enhancements to your
  character and their items.
* An advanced and balanced monetary system.
* An arena that allows any players to battle without repercussions.
* Unique areas, and tons of them.  None of these cut and paste areas 
  either.  DoD has been around for over seven years and alot of 
  thought has gone into the creation and development of our areas.
* Many unique spells and skills developed by our team (just to list 
  a few):
  -Cast spells effects that stay in rooms and even roam for a length 
   of time.
  -Creating and setting of traps.
  -A unique mapping system if you have the skill or spell.
  -And much more...

Description :

                WARNING: ADULT CONTENT

     It's not known when or how the Island known as Hideaway
came into exsistance. It was simply there, exsisting in a
state outside of time itself. Every so often, in different
places in the world, the boundaries of the Island would
encroach into one of the many worlds in the multiverse and a
portal would open. Sometimes for days, sometimes for only
moments. Of course, it was inevitable that eventually people
would fall into those portals and end up upon the Island.

     At first, only a few appeared, many baffled as they
discovered only females seemed to be able to exsist on the
Island. The men who found themselves upon the island were
changed by the place's magic. Those first arrivals found the
fishing around the island to be plentiful and prosperous, and
so a small fishing village, the village of Hideaway, was born
there in the sheltered cove. Over the years, however, more and
more people began to appear, the appearance of portals in the
real world beginning to grow more frequent. The population
began to grow, forming and shaping into an open, friendly
environment for all kinds of women, with all kinds of
different interests. Now, a few hundred years after the first
few people found themselves transported to Hideaway, the
little village has grown into a bustling town, full of lively
activity and fun.

     HideawayMUSH is a place designed to be a safe, open and
friendly place for lesbian interaction. We welcome female and
male players alike, but for thematic reasons we only allow
female characters. This is ment to be a place where womyn can
go to explore various aspects of themselves and generally have
fun in a roleplaying setting.

Description :

   The full moon shown brightly over the Pangea,
casting deep shadows among the warehouses along
the docks.  On nights like this, the city gates are locked
tight, with extra guards posted.  Sane people are
asleep in their houses, or drinking in a busy tavern,
forgetting the terrors which are happening beyond the
safety of the city walls. Tonight the mood was much
more somber than the typical nightly ruckus which
normally filled the bars.  The full moon alone meant that
the dead would be out in full force, but the recent bloody
assaults by the hill giants in the forests to the north
would contribute many fresh members to the army of
the dead. There was some hope tonight.  A band of
Mystic Knights had recently arrived in town, fresh in
from their battles on the wild southern continent.  They
would do their best protect the few people who hadn't
made it to the city, and fragment the army enough to
prevent a full assault.  But everyone knew a few
wouldn't get a chance to see the sun rise.

  For those of you who have not yet been in Deeper Trouble, let me tell you that it is
very old. It goes back to 1990 and was created by a handful computerscience students.

Artesia - as the world is named - is, and always will be, strictly fantasy-based,
and although it has its roots in the stories of J.R.R. Tolkien, many other species
that share its theme and spirit also populate it these days.

It is constantly being improved and new additions and changes come often. This is no
DIKU style MUD. It is complex by nature and thus very challenging and exciting.

One can here enjoy wandering about in a large world, either alone or in a party with
other players. Since the different areas and puzzles are very distinct, although not
by theme or connection, there is always a new challenge waiting for any adventurer
regardless of skill and experience. Players also tend to stride to become the best.

There is also a social aspect to the game. Many new friends have been made, and
also real-life gatherings are being arranged now and then so that the true people of
Artesia may exchange gossip, face to face and over a mug of dark ale. :-)

WWW         : http://www.smartmonsters.com
Description :

TriadCity is a large-scale multiuser role-playing game
with a literary orientation, currently in beta.

While role-playing MUDs are fairly common, this one is
different.  Where most MUDs focus on 'kill the
monster' style adventuring, TriadCity explores themes
which have been central to Western culture: good and evil,
city and country, nature and civilization, personal and
collective identities, violence and nonviolence, freedom
and slavery.

'Literary orientation' means that narrative
techniques from the novel and other traditions are
incorporated, such as voice, point of view,
characterization, plot, and so on. Various forms of
subjectivity are imposed on the characters which players
create, some relative, some radical. This means that
character histories and views of the world are potentially
unique to each individual player.

We opened to the public on 10/1/01 and are just starting
to build our player base.  We hope you'll check us out, and
will tell us what you think!

Mud         : Spectors of Distopia
Code Base   : [Dawn] Highly modified.
Telnet      : pointblue.mine.nu 2735 [24.103.105.227]
WWW         : None
Description :

How many MUD's have you played that are enjoyable, but the
staff is dictatorial, egotisitcal, and the role of the mortal
characters are the peons of a domineering group of immortals?
How many MUD's have you played that are essentially ruined by
the out of control staff? 

We at SoD believe that the mortals make a game. Without
players, you have no MUD. Look at it a thousand different ways
and that etho still applies. To make a MUD truly successful
you need a satisfied playerbase, not an addicted one that
keeps coming around because they have nowhere else to go. Our
goal at SoD is to be the MUD you go to because it's not only
an amazing game, but it's the second home to players and
immortals alike. We offer a global roleplaying theme for all to 
follow if desired, but leave personal roleplaying lines open for
individuality from player to player. Classes and races are
being reworked to allow for class AND race remorts that will
provide a system in which nearly every character can be completely
unique. 

Currently we're open for BETA playertesters, so if you'd like
to be a part of the final steps in the creation process of
SoD, drop by sometime and give us a try. 

-Leanna, Orlin, and the staff of SoD.

That's right, that's the smell of Demons Gate! So come on

   Demon's Gate is a pure fantasy role-playing environment (though role-
playing isn't required). Features include a complex combat system with new 
detailed critical hits, detailed npcs, quests, guilds and clubs. The mud is 
divided into a number of variously themed domains including those based on 
J.R.R. Tolkien, Robert Jordan, and a few all-original domains. 

   DG is a very fast-growing mud, with interesting new areas, guilds and 
systems being introduced all the time. After gaining some experience 
playing DG, players are welcome to apply for wizardhood, even with no prior 
coding experience.

WWW         : http://www.looney.com/
Description :

  LooneyMud is a myriad of things, depending on your point of view. For some people here,
it's a way of life, a place to always fall back on for friends and recreation, while to
others its a place to languish and fail, a waste of time to be avoided. It's a world
filled with pop culture, some of it faithfully transposed, and much of it faithfully
ridiculed. A virtual world filled with travellers from all ends of the online globe, all
backgrounds, races, colours, and ages. Most of all, its a good place to kill some time.
 
On LooneyMud you'll travel throughout the realms of pop culture's creations, tainted
through the efforts of our Creators to provide as much abnormality as humanly possible.
Most subjects tend to be drawn from television and the cinema, ranging through comics to
cartoons, from sitcoms to major motion pictures.
 
You take on the persona of someone immersed in this alternate reality, your skills and
outlooks shaped by your choice of membership to one of our many guilds. You then guide
this character through 300 levels (which is much less than it seems), to eventually rise
either to hero, an immortal-like level, or perhaps even make the jump to Apprentice
Creator, beginning a whole new way to take your character further.
 
 
LooneyMud, its cooler than Canada, and you don't need to pass through customs and declare
your cigarettes.

  Dark Forest is a fairly new SMAUG based mud that is aiming to attract
YOU. We offer player owned/run orders for envisionistic peacefuls, and
player owned/run clans for domineering deadlies. We discourage over-use
of immortal intervention to encourage Roll Playing, and free their
availability for questions or problems. A large deity database provides
a great (fantasy)theological platform for even more rollplaying. Clan
points provide clans with a way to quantify their status in the world,
and can be used to buy more room, or even power. We have included many
subtle features to make your playing experience better, but not
drasticaly different from standard smaug. We are sill looking for
builders, but would like to see some form of dedication before you are
provided with an immortal account. We have a wide collection of stock
areas which we plan to keep, and have started adding new areas. We are
open to suggestions, as well as open to both new players--to smaug or to
mudding--and!  experienced players--to one or both--to help teach the
new ones, or to slaughter them ;). Come visit, enjoy the Forest, and
help dispel the darkness.

classes (3 for each basic class), and after reaching level 
60 you can advance to legendary levels which offers new 
skills and spells and generally greatly enhances your 
character. To reach 5th legendary level, you have to come
through special challenge, which will test your knowledge of
your character, so only the best players can ever reach 5th
legendary level. Of course you have more attempts available,
but not unlimited amount :) Successfully completing the
challenge opens whole new range of possibilities to advance
your character far beyond limits of lower legends. But only
few reached this status, and they are honored as gods among
other mortals. In near future there will be completely new
remort engine which will offer totally new possibilities.

alignment bound classes, but be wary, though these classes are powerful, if
you stray too far from the alignment, your guild will no longer accept you.
We are currently updating a lot of our areas with our unique MIML (MUD
Internal Markup Language) code. When you are drunk and in some areas, you
see other messages than you would while sober.  We have many quests, which
test your mind as well as your strength, not the normal find the quest-item
type.  So if you're looking for a challenge, wanting something different,
sharpen your blade, and your wits, and come play Desolation of the Dragon
II, it's sure to be worth your while.

as a new race-class combination which is picked randomly.

We have all of AVATAR's experimental and grandfathered
classes as well as all of the NPC races (making the total
40!) for this.  You could end up reincarnated as a Golem
Sorcerer or a Goblin Monk.  With 9 classes and 40 races,
there is plenty of variation.

Enjoy and you are welcome to play!  Avatar West plans on
being around for a long time and has the same technical and
developmental staff as the traditional AVATAR.

WWW         : http://fote.gageendal.com
Description :

The year is 2438, exactly four hundred years after the discovery of
ancient technology on the planet Mars on the second manned shuttle to
the red planet. Mankind, in our arrogance, took the technology and
turned it into the fuel of our weapons of destruction against each-
other. Theories that World War IV would be fought with sticks and
stones were greatly over-enthusiastic. WW III lasted nearly twelve
years and lost nearly 200 million souls from across the globe. 

By the year 2099, the first fully functional spaceport was created on
our moon. Luna Base, as it was once called, served as an inter-
national space port for all of the Earth. It was also the cause of
the first interstellar war, and World War Four. This war was fought
almost entirely in space, though many ground troops died, mostly the
fight was against technology's power in space. Trillions of  dollars
were lost durring the war and none of the sides ended up the winner.
The end of that war was literaly the lack of firepower in the year
2138. The final seasefire was declared on May 3rd, 2140 at the White
House when all of the main leaders of each of the countries, along
with all of their cabinet seats signed a document that allowed for
nearly full use of the Spaceport by all countries. 

A Subclause of the treaty is that all countries would meet at the
Capitol  Building in Washington D.C. every two years. Since the
signing of that treaty, not a single member has ever missed a meeting.

New colonies begun to form on the other satelites in the system. The
Under-Ice colony of Europa, Io's subterranian colony on it's orbit
around Jupiter. There are even rumors of unclaimed colonies that have
begun to be sighted on the Asteroid Belts.

it's a carbuncle) of cities, venture hubwards across the
brassica'ed Sto Plains to the Ramtops, cross the Circle Sea
to the dark and mysterious continent of Klatch.

Discworld combines the humour and richness of Terry's books
with a high-quality mud that appeals to both fans and those
who have never read his work. As a very kind reviewer said:
'With fish, wombles, intelligent shades of blue, straw
dummies, shiny plaques, mended drums, Shifty Jim,
Ankh-Morpork pence all on a very chilly spindlewinter's
afternoon, Discworld had me laughing at every second turn,
and left me wanting to read more.

'The feeling I got from the mud was one of fun, quirkiness,
and constant surprises. I spent a whole lot more time on
there than I expected, but it was time well spent!'

gods, sixteen completely different infinite planes, forming a ring. Imagine
a neutral bufferzone in the centre of this ring, forming a plane of its own.
Imagine an infinitely tall spire in the centre of the infinite bufferzone.
Imagine a city, like a tiny ringworld on its side, hovering on top of this
infinite spire. This city is Sigil, accessible only by portal and the only
place barred to the gods. Where all from angels to demons, to the various
mortal races in between, meet.

Description :

  Furscape is a multilateral world that plays 200 years from now, an original,
Furry-themed science fiction universe where so-called 'Recoms', beings bred
by combining human and animal DNA, are the predominant species. Mankind has
perished in an apocalyptic war 150 years ago, and the furries (recoms)
escaped the slaughtering by fleeing to a colony on the moon, which has since
then become their home. The discovery of hyperspace jumpgates and electron
confinement fusion has led to massive space exploration, and furs now live
on various worlds and space stations. Alien species have been discovered,
and a brisk exchange of trade commodities has begun. Factions have formed,
ranging from free trader associations to bounty hunter and pirate alliances,
military organizations, and mysterious intelligence agencies.

-- Some technical info:
Many of our worlds allow for free, large scale roaming, making use of the
well-known Terraform system. Worlds are original, with their cores hand-built
by dedicated realm managers, many of them large enough to be considered a
small MUCK of their own.

WWW         : http://www.labyrinth.net.au/~cjp/
Description :

   Dominia Mud is based on the popular card game 'Magic: The Gathering' by 
Wizards of the Coast. Your adventure begins in the fabled City of Brass,
where members of all races and classes mingle without restriction. As a
beginning character, you are given the choice of playing one of twelve
classes, and one of eight races, all of which have their own advantages 
and disadvantages.

Chaos Mages are masters of destructive and combat magic, Saboteurs can
build bombs capable of destroying entire rooms, Necromancers swell their
armies of followers with the bodies of their enemies, Hunters shoot their
prey from many rooms away with deady accuracy, and the remaining eight
classes have similarly clearly defined areas of expertise.

Above level 11 players may multiclass freely, at a cost in 'credits' much
greater than the single credit required to level in the primary class.

Our community of players consists of a mix of magic addicts from around
the world and non-magic players who found themselves strangely unable to
stop playing.

been accepted into human society. But rest is not easy; ghosts
are always about.

  We have many unique programs and much in the way of eye-candy;
ASCII images and ANSI color included. We have ryokan (hotel
rooms) that you can stay in or you can build your own areas. The
staff is friendly. Our only requirement is that you do not lounge

A structured nobility system lets players build their own

intrigue and scheming.

Our entertaining and challenging quests are richly detailed 
and require a combination of swordsmanship and careful 
thought. New players have many quests designed just for 
their lower level status.

Several guilds are available that grant additional power to
your character. You'll even find the Gods that run the Den 
are often on the game and interact with the mortals 
regularly.

All of this combined is what makes this a MUD to come back

Description :

 
 I started playing rp muds back in 1980 with Dungeons and Dragons,
 always fascinated with the gaming culture I learned all I could
 about it, studying the old DMG I learned how to be a gamesmaster
 and developed my own gameworld. And then about 1994 I discovered
 the internet and the first thing I discovered about it was that
 you could play rp games on it, and so I did, the first mud I played
 was called Nemesis it was a lpc and it was a great mud, but it went
 away.. all the while I was exploring other styles of muds including
 Mercs and The End of the Line,
 And then about 1996 I started playing Rot in the form of Eternal
 Insomnia I was always got pk'd but it was fun, anyway that mud
 developed some internal problems and soon it was gone.. Well then
 along came lionheart.net, before EI went away I got interested in
 developing my own mud so I downloaded the code and began working on
 it, a friend of mine gave me an account at lionheart. net and I had
 a shell to work with, so after EI died I started Alturia.. That was
 just the beginning, Alturia has went through three codebases, it
 started as Rot1 .4, then Russ Walsh came by for a visit and offered
 me RoT1.5b6 then due to some bad management I lost that codebase,
 so I went back to 1.4 and started over, a little while later Russ
 came back and offered me 2.0 to co-develop, He said he was very busy
 and didn't have time, 2.0 needed a few things to get it basically
 running but run it would and soon after I got it running I opened it,
 hehheh, a bit to soon I think, then all the things that needed work
 showed up, (that was a lesson) well I've been steadily working on it,
 but took a few years off after my second free server built a firewall
 and I couldnt get in, (I've since learned not to depend on free
 servers) I'm really not an internet guru so at the time I didn't
 know how to get in so I just kinda lost interest and figured that at
 the right time I would come back and finish what I started..
 Alturia is the original of the RoT2 .0 class, co-developed with
 Russ Walsh and maintained by the DAC code team, Alturia is a
 solid mud with an exceptional group of coders.
 Alturia has
 - Stances
 - A very smart AI system
 - Mobiles that can advance
 - A new pk feature that requires new pkers to qualify themselves and
   gives them a chance to try it out before its permanent,
 - A pk gear system that enables pkers to aquire special equipment,
 - AutoQuest
 - Global Socials
 - Global Emote
 - Autostance
 - Dodge and Parry revamped,
 - Arena code
 - Four tiers
 - Dual class at third tier
 - A special way to advance to the next tier,
   you keep your original and create a new character at the next tier
 - Special types of attacks and more.

  It has been several years since the death of Lancelot and the

with the leadership of the Round Table, have been unable to stop
a particlar tribe, lead by a man called Richard the Bloody, from
pushing South from Scotland.  With each passing day, the tribe's
power and influence grows.  It's been nearly six months since
Camelot sent an army to investigate an insertgance into their
lands.  The army returned home with a quarter their numbers, and
what was left could barely be called an army.  For six months,
the new border villages and towns have reported no movement along
Richard's lines.
 
  It's been three days since the normally daily heralds have been
seen from the town of New Haven.  In response, a small party was
dispatched from York.  They too have not returned.  Nearly half a
year has been spent in waiting for this moment - Richard the
Bloody is on the move again.The city of York stands in the direct
path between Camelot and Richard's army.
 
  Will you help defend Camelot, or will you join the ranks of
perhaps the most ruthless barbarian of known history and help
overthrow King Arthur?  Welcome to DragonHeart MUSH, a roleplay
game where you can play a character in the Dark Ages of Medvial
England.  You help write the story.  Will you be nobility,

populace is made up of pirates, infiltrators, thieves, vampires,
wizards, questors, merchants, poets, gypsies, ambassadors from other

'Core' is a planet at the fringe of the populated galaxy, 650 years into
the future. 'The Company' has established a mining colony here, and your
role as player is a mining colony worker.
*Player-run merchant shops: work in a store, set prices, comissions, add
 goods, etc. Expect to be employed in a shop after only a few days playing
 time!
*Free housing: get your own house. In most muds, this would cost millions
 of gold... on Core, you get a house FREE, when you reach _third_ level!
*Extensive mining system: on Core, there are no legions of monsters that
 are magically carrying coins. Our economy makes a lot more sense; you
 earn wages from mining.
*Customize equipment: the aforementioned shops can make custom items.
 Want some affordable clothes exactly to your liking? Just as the 
 shopkeeper to sew some up!
*Care to gamble? Head over to the Recreation dome and try your luck on
 slots, blackjack, poker, or Core's very own game 'CoreQuad'. We even
 have a stock market!
*Consistant environment: ever play a futuristic mud that just happens
 to have spells and goblins? Not so on Core! Everything is in theme,
 and EVERYTHING in this sci-fi mud is completely original.
*Events: who knows what disaster might happen? There could be anything
 from a meteor shower to a pirate invasion! Every day is an adventure.

So, if you need a break from those same old muds, please give us a try!
We promise you will not be disapointed.

Here's a small sampling of our best:

* From classic horror themes to cartoons, Quake, anime and the
X Files, our original areas are fun for both the exploring
and kamikaze mob killer alike, some even having 300+ rooms.
* Bloodbath Tower, one of the coolest Quest Areas in existence
in use for the top-tiered players, which offers awesome merge
quests, its own unique token system and a continuous fun
challenge even for the seasoned veterans.
* Various fun quests, including trivia, extreme hot potato,
scavenger hunts, scrabble, socket games, dice, paintball
hot potato and even mob creation/building contests.
* And of course, the players and staff's personal favorite,
Dreams has a MASSIVE top-tier Smurfs zone, offering hundreds
of unique and hilarious mobs and objects, and a final Pokemon
inspired Smurf card quest bound to keep any player up late
collecting.

Finally, what fantasy would be complete without a tiered
remort system that gives access to lots of spells and skills
and many unique clans full of wonderful like-minded individuals
with their own guilds and clan member rooms to enjoy. So come
and visit, the smurfs will be thankful for your blood.

classes to choose from. But, classes are pretty balanced.
Not only can you quest for QPs, but you can also exchange 
gems, etc for qps. A unique slab has been added 
called 'Uranium' worth 10k qps! The mud is not up as of 
yet because I am still changing stuff, and would rather
have the mud ready to play. So come and have fun.

Description :

 This MUD started out as a GodWars codebase; but, it has since
been stripped, and almost completely rewritten. This MUD is
nothing if not innovative. Nearly everything about the way a
Godwars MUD functions has been changed. The current classes
available may not seem unique at first; but, they have been
completely redesigned and recoded so that players can experience
something different from all the ordinary MUDs.  The MUD also
features an extraordinary environmental system which encompasses
such things as: weather, building, mining, lumberjacking,
forging, carving, and sewing. The MUD's world is presently
small, but entirely original. We are looking for players who are
willing to stay and test, even though the pbase is small and
there are still bugs to work out of the system. All bugs found
will be fixed promptly and all ideas or suggestions will be
considered. The MUD will always be in development; because, we
will never run out of interesting new ideas to implement. We are
striving to create an absolutely immersive game environment
where players can have fun without being subjected to harassment
from other players or the adminstrative staff; therefore, we ask
that players show a certain level of maturity. If this sounds
like something you would be interested in, then we cordially
invite you to help in the continuing development of our project.

Sincerely,
The 7th Plane Adminstrative Staff

Dragons Domain 4 has passed its second birthday, and we're on a
recruitment drive at the moment.  We're a friendly bunch and you
should find us happy to help out if you're new.  We've got some
fabulous unique areas and features, come and check us out!
*****
1 September 2002 Version 4 of the Domain has been released!

After a hiatus, as past players were starting to lose hope, a 
saviour was found and the Domain has risen from the ashes.  The
immortals took this opportunity to make some changes and 
officially release Version 4.

The Dragons Domain is a heavily customised, both in areas and
source code, Envy MUD.  Over the past 8 years the Domain has 
evolved from a simple Envy MUD to a unique and well-loved 
fantasy game.  We have a number of builders who only build for 
the Domain and two dedicated implementors currently active.

Some of our unique features include: a deity system which allows
players to choose a patron deity; an interactive tournament
system, including custom-written bots; a pre-requisite skill
system that encourages characters to learn a wide range of 
skills; and a sub-class system once players achieve level 30.

We welcome new and old players to try their hand at mastering 
the Domain!

Description :

In a world where darkness is your enemy. You can't hide, and there is no
stopping it. Our planets are turning into breeding grounds for drugs, 
prostitutes, and mindless violence. Drug lords roam the land trying to 
get you addicted to the virus of the mind, to suck you in to the ever 
dyeing abyss. Prostitutes scour the earth selling themselves for any 
scrap they can get while new technology develops from simple guns to 
complex starships, though they are crashing faster then ever. Blood lies 
in ever street corner and the Mercenaries are nothing but ruthless. 
Civilians are the targets to recruit of these blood thirsty barbarians. 
For those who are likely to be taken in only to have little safety. It 
isn't much better then standing on a chair with a noose on your neck 
waiting for someone to kick it, maybe even hoping for it. From planet to 
planet, group to group, seeking power, safety, a means for living. 

We have our own reasons for doing what we do, killing destroying plaguing, 
but more often than not it comes down to survival. Survival of the fittest 
many have said well. The fight for supreme rule continues. Trying is 
useless. You will die. Can you trust your neighbor, family,...or even 
yourself?! Here is the test, are you ready?!

 600 years after a final battle, which turned out not to be very final
rumours about a group of people who can tap into the True Power at will are

Winds of Change has an intriguing setting after the books by Robert Jordan,
where Saidin is no longer tainted and the True Power is accesible by some
individuals without going through the Dark One, but at a heavy cost.
We are trying to create a unique code setting, where a real channeling
system, form combat, mob factions and advanced skill code are just a
few of them.

The mud is still very much in its development stages and suffered from
a few heavy setbacks, but we aren't willing to give up. We're looking
for some mature and talented coders/builders who are interrested in 
dedicating their time to create this as much as we are. We have a user
friendly OLC for building and will be happy to teach you everything you
need to know to use it.

WWW         : http://www.dune3.net/
Description :

 Dune III MUSH is set roughly 100 years prior to the opening of Dune, with House
Corrino being firmly in control of the Imperium. Houses Atreides and
Harkonnen are not nearly so pivotal to the plot as they are in the novel,
though they do have a presence in the game. The Fremen, an unknown entity at
this point in the timeline, have no real contact with the Known Universe.
The Bene Gesserit Sisterhood remains quietly but firmly intertwined in the
affairs of the Imperium, the true depth of their subtle influences sensed by
none beyond their order. Kaitain, the Imperial Seat, is the center of
role-play, although RP on the hereditary and contractual fiefs of the Houses
Major is supported and encouraged.

 Politics and intrigue are the hands which weave intricate storylines and
plots amongst the players. To ensure the focus remains on the RP, DuneIII
does not employ the use of a combat system, and economy is only minimally
coded to support the CHOAM contract system. You will find no hack and slash
gaming on DuneIII; the outcome of physical clashes will be determined based
on consent between the players involved. The tenet of IC (In Character)
Actions leading to IC Consequences (ICA=ICC) is a concept of importance to
all.

battles, guild halls, random equipment drops and many many other
advanced features Duris provides new and expert mudders alike
with a level of mudding excitement not found any place else.

  Duris is built around the constant war between the good and
evil races of Faerun where the players are split between the two
sides.

  Gather your forces of light and descend into the darkness of
the UnderDark, where the evil duergar and drow dwell. Battles
occur dayly with old heros dying and new being born. Are you up
for the Duris experience? There is only one way to find out...

Recently, the elders of Israel traveled to Hebron where
they anointed David as king of all the tribes of Israel,

Although the Israelites still have many enemies, David's
kingdom now stretches from Kadesh and Tadmor in the north
to Sinai in the south. He rules from his new cedar palace
in Jerusalem which was built using workers and materials
sent by Hiram, king of Tyre.

The Ark of the Covenant is in Jerusalem in a tent which
David pitched for it. At Gibeon, the Levites present burnt
offerings, morning and evening, in accordance with the Law
of the Lord. Now, David wishes to build a temple for the
Lord, but alas, that task will pass to his son. David must
prepare the way for what is to come, by vanquishing Israel's
enemies and bringing peace and prosperity to the kingdom.

Come and join David and his mighty men in their HolyQuest!!

Description :

 Welcome to the mystical fantasy world that is The Edge of Darkness. Within
this ancient alternate reality lies a vast medieval realm know as Doraak,
filled with adventure, danger and wonders beyond imagination. Almost every
type of terrain conceivable can be found within Doraak's ever expanding
boundaries..from the icy arctic wastelands to the mine-filled Tahrenian
mountain ranges of the dwarves. There are the sprawling grasslands of the
west and the great barren deserts of the far south. There are numerous
islands in the northern and southern oceans and there are the measureless
swamps of the east. There are all these regions, plus hundreds more just
waiting to be explored. And throughout all of these lands lie countless
ancient forests, some of which are bright and pleasant, yet others are damp,
dark and perilous. In this realm, any path can lead to discovery,
adventure...or death!
 
These wild, rugged lands are only recently beginning to yield to the
influences of civilized society, as the many humanoid races of Doraak
struggle to establish small pockets of civilization amongst the far-reaching
and untamed wilderness. There are a number of cities and villages that can
provide safe haven to a weary adventurer. However, even these seemingly
peaceful towns can offer far more than just a good night's rest, to the
inquisitive or careless explorer.
 
In spite of humankind's best efforts, there are still dark forces at work
within Doraak, which seek to undermine all that has been accomplished. Both
the minions of evil and the misguided good lurk everywhere throughout the
realms, and beyond, building strength and patiently waiting for their time
to come again...
 
So come and test your might, your skill and your cunning against all that
The Edge of Darkness has in store...for the world of Doraak awaits its next
savior...or victim!

3000+ users and 5500+ rooms. Set between the times of The Hobbit and The
Lord of the Rings, Elendor is devoted to providing a quality roleplaying

automated. On Elendor, players may take on a character from any of 5 diff-
erent races and 22 different cultures of Middle-earth, each of which has a
dedicated staff of players ready to help you learn the game and how to
play. The staff on Elendor is especially helpful and friendly to players
who are new to Tolkien and/or to MUSHing in general.

   The roleplaying environment on Elendor consists of a beautiful and acc-
urate representation of Tolkien's land of Middle-earth where room descrip-
tions change dynamically with the time of day, seasons, and weather. Elen-
dor has an extensive global command system which includes a finely-tuned
skill/stat-based combat system, a full economic system with several forms
of currency, an elaborate language system with support for 19 different
spoken and written Tolkien languages, and a convenient wardrobe system
with which you can create a detailed collection of descriptions for your
character. Elendor also provides a custom designed chat system with over
100 channels and its own mailer system equipped with over 100 bulletin
boards where players plan game activities and discuss Tolkien's writing.

Description :

  Elephant Mud is one of the older, larger and more advanced 
muds out on the net today, with a wealth of experience
behind it. Offering a wealth of features not found on
its competitors, it brings totally unique guilds, noble
Houses, sophisticated multi-classing, bloodlines, stamina,
player run newspapers, exploration rewards, and much much 
more to an arena awash with 'stock' alternatives.

Elephant Mud allows PK, but it is socially controlled. The
town Council can bounty, fine, jail and execute people
for breaking the law. Laws are both set and enforced by
players and Council have sophisticated investigative tools
as their disposal. A clever criminal still has a chance
of course, and the fight between law and chaos goes on
eternally.

The mud is set in a medieval/dark ages world, where 
magic, not science, is the key area of research. Humans,
Dwarves, Elves and many other races rub shoulders and
work with (and against) each other to defend, or bring
down the town of Drakenwood and its environs. It is a 
dangerous world, but a world equally of great rewards,
and truely has something for everyone.

Elephant Mud has 3000-4000 regular players, many of which
have been playing for in excess of 5 years with a notable
number who have been here for 7, 8, 9 or even 10 years.
With longevity like that we invite you to come and find
out for yourself what all the fuss is about. Who knows,
you may even decide to stay!

magic system that uses memorization instead of mana, learn by use instead of
practicing, skill based intensity of spells rather than lost concentrations,
along with years of other modifications and you've got something unique.

  We support the usual multiple coin types, bankers, colors, etc. that go with
most muds.  Empires interface is dominated more by words rather than numbers and
this adds to the role playing context.

Give this mud a shot and you'll be listing it amongst your favorites for years.

Description :

   The 8 classes and 10 races of The Age of Legacy offer diversity without confusion, 
the fact that balance was a priority is obvious to anybody who plays the 
game.  The 91 level, unique remort system allows you to be reborn when you 
weary of your current life, each life you find yourselves with different 
strengths and weaknesses, talents and gifts, but sometimes also handicaps.  
However, from life to life your strength and knowledge inevitably increases.  
Leveling, questing, roleplaying, and pking ... even chatting, you can pick 
and choose which you would like to do, all are encouraged, none are 
mandatory, so that everybody can find what they like to do, and not have to 
do what they hate.  The new evolvable spells and skills system allows you to 
rediscover new ways to use existing skills, and watch their power increase.  
Custom clans can wage battles with each other, pit strategies and perserverance 
against each other, and destroy their most hated enemies by ravaging the opposite 
side.  

   The Age of Legacy is filled with adventure, be it in going off on grand quests, 
creating and maintaining your own clan, battling scores of monsters, searching 
for treasures to strengthen your power, or challenging other players to a duel 
of skill, wits, and blades.  Whatever you are looking for, you will find it at The 
Age of Legacy.  Venture in for a taste, you won't regret it.

     It's the Interval after the discovery of AIVAS, but 
the AI portion of the computer was damaged, so 
technological influence remains limited.  Two Weyrs exist

established trading post (Kalseru Weyr).  A subterranean 
Hold near Starmount, Icevale, is beginning to flourish.

     Anyone may create a resident or apprentice Crafter, 
while ranking characters, and blue, green, or brown
dragonriders are available to players who demonstrate
sufficient knowledge of the setting.

by daily events.  We also have moderated chats as well, featuring VIP
guests, which in the past have included book authors, movie and

The immortals are friendly, active and casual.  The rules

of mature people provides the luxury of giving personal
attention to players. 

The nine classes and subclasses have been carefully created
to provide unique skill or spell sets for each. Balance is
the key. Classes and races are so balanced, there isn't a 
bad choice. Enuph is a stable mud based on the concepts of

Description :

  On the south coast of Estria, between T'shombe Forest and the Great Ocean,
rests the island city state of Anaj Naiesta. From the islands of Dhynara, in
the east, come ships bearing spices and other wares. These diametrically
differing cultures render Anaj Naiesta a place of unsurpassed diversity. It
is  in this city that we set the scene.
 
Dark Prophets MUSH is a game focusing on quality role-play in an interesting
environment. The theme is original, a tale of generic fantasy juxtaposed
with an Arabian Nights style culture, and features despotic prophets, brave
warriors, independent artists and wise sages. The game deals with the
eternal struggle between the light and the dark, between what is right and
what is wrong.
 
It should be noted that DarkProphets does NOT employ a combat system, an
econ system, or even a magic system. This is an RP by consent mush, where we
believe that through a minimal amount of code we can achieve a better
quality of free-form rp.
 
That said, player backgrounds are encouraged after a player has been with us
for a few weeks, and code does exist for taking care of that.

 We've been around for some time now.  DBStar is a mud where
we emphasise having fun: There is a strong roleplay streak
running through the mud that links with a 'fallout' style 
perks system, and a jobs system that is reminiscent of Final
Fantasy games. A ship system, Housing systems, an extended stats
system, hiscore boards, customized equipment, a dragonball wish
system, extensive race and skill options, a skill capsule system
akin to 'Dragonball Z : Budokai', rewards for dogged players,
over 180 skills split between over 10 races, unique abilities
like bodyswap, egg laying and genocide attack, poll and voting 
systems, and a unique 'train' command.

  There is no limit to player statistics, with technically
infinite hitpoints and kipoints available, and players can
indulge in side-missions, roleplaying, item hunting, and more
real-life tasks, such as fishing, and creating their own items.
Roleplay is automatically rewarded by the MUD, and the points
gained can be used in a number of ways - Including Fusion. Points
earned from completing missions goes towards jobs, or small
rewards, like power increases or items.

  Now on a new, lag-free server with 100% uptime, we guarantee that
playing DBStar will be one of the best things you've ever done!

 Throughout the towns of Prexion, Aden, and Einar, many 
tales have been told of the legend of the DragonStone. Most
believe the stories are that of a fool's imagination. Few, 
though, dare to venture beyond the towns to seek the 
truth..... Are YOU one of these? 

The Legend tells of a great Golden Dragon called Corin-Mur, 
who holds the stone within its lair. It is said that the 
stone holds the key to immortality.

Choose from 16 races and 14 classes. Multiclass if you 
desire. Breathe life into whatever you create.

There are many great tasks and quests to complete in your 
search for the DragonStone. You must seek the aid of 
others; alone, you are sure to fail. Join one of the clans, 
or seek help from the friends you will make.

   Dreamers has been in the development stage for nearly 
a year, and is now open for playing, though things are 
still a bit rough around the edges.  The theme is Fantasy,
with surrealism and creativity strongly encouraged.  We 
have no policies on role play, and would like people to 
play the game in the manner that they enjoy the most.  We 
are interested in hiring coders, either experienced coders, 
or inexperienced folks with a creative turn of mind and good 
verbal skills.  

Our race selection is a bit unusual in that new players can 
choose to merge two races to obtain some characteristics of 
each, and some limbs of each.  It's a bit random, so unusual
physical characteristics are easily attained.  With five 
different races to choose from, there are 25 possible 
combinations.

The classes will be entirely run by players, once they are 
approved, and the people proposing a new class can select 
the government, recruitment policy, primary and secondary 
stats, name, and defining characteristics of that class.

Description :

A MUCK for people who like dramatic role playing in a medieval
environment, Sherwood MUCK strives to capture a whimsical but dark spirit by
casting anthropomorphic animals in the roles of 13th century peasants,
nobles and outlaws. Dispensing with magic and mythological creatures, this
MUCK concentrates on realistic role play with realistic consequences. Not a
medieval re-creation MUCK, looseness is allowed in areas that make the game
more fun, and the fun parts of medieval life are concentrated on instead of
the miseries.

Sherwood MUCK boasts a large public area and high standards on building,
characters and plots. In addition, Sherwood MUCK is fun for the whole family
since there are strict rules of public conduct, making sure players will not
stumble across sexual situations during the course of their play. No doubt,
this is a MUCK for people who specifically seek dramatic medieval role
playing, not so much for those who wish to socialize.
Finally, in answer to one of the most commonly asked questions, Sherwood
MUCK is not based on any single movie or story of Robin Hood. Instead, it is
fairly original, being an amalgam of influences but tending most toward the
actual folklore and earliest writings concerning Robin Hood. That means we
welcome your original characters, and you should by no means feel limited to
fulfilling stereotypes.

So if you like dramatic role play, medieval times, the legends of Robin
Hood, or merely wish to try playing a character in a well-organized and
high-quality environment, come give Sherwood MUCK a try! Characters are
created on the spot by staffers and wizards and no applications are
required for standard characters. Hope to see you there!

Description :

Exodus is much more than a standard MUD. It’s the culmination of
over 8 years of progress and growth. Environments interact with
you as you journey through colorful lands, with the look and
feel of a well-written fantasy novel.

Choose from a variety of races. Some you know, like Dwarves,
Elves, and Humans. Others you may not, like Vro'ath and Litans.
Exodus has a quest-based remort system, so you can join more
unique races later in the game.

In the course of 90 levels, you have the option to switch
classes twice for multiclass combinations, but also rewarding
pure-class specialists with the most powerful skills and magic.
If you don't like your profession, you can reincarnate any time
and keep most of the experience you’ve earned.

Explorer? Immerse yourself in a huge world of custom areas with
over 17,000 rooms. Forget Midgaard and other stock areas. You
won't find them here. Two richly-detailed continents lie
within a great ocean spotted with islands large and small to
constantly challenge and reward the adventurous explorer.

We have a PK-based clan system and a variety of clans.
Wars let enemies to settle differences on the battlefield. A
bounty system puts rewards on the heads of those you cannot
kill. If you like friendly combat, we have two arenas for PvP
battles in a controlled environment. We also have regular PK
free-for-alls called Battle Royale, turning the game into a
bloodbath with a declared winner at the end. An in-depth kill
count system tracks your wins and losses in combat.

haughty nobles, scheming guilders, and self-righteous
clergy squabble over the technological remnants of the lost
Second Republic. Now humankind has been reunited under the
banner of Alexius Hawkwood. Will the new Emperor halt the
descent into darkness and restore humankind's belief in
renewal and progress, or will the Light fade at last from
the universe?

The Fading Suns MUSH is set on the planet Vargo, a world
threatened by alien invasions and supernatural incursions.
Players take on the role of nobles, members of the League
of Merchants, and clergy of the Universal Church. Take a

Description :

  The year: 2001. The New Heroic Age has just begun. Heroes and villains
abound in numbers far surpassing the benchmarks for the historical and
'mythological' heroes and villains of yesteryear. The threats, while still
categorized as good vs. evil, have been altered with the emergence of
magic, psionics, technology, alien species, mutants, clones, and even
agents of higher powers such as the Earthborn Angels, Mephisto, or the
Hellspawn.Earth is, unfortunately, woefully unprepared for the challenges
it is about to face from the convergence of all these intersections. The
United Nations is nervous, the leading countries of the world not far
behind. Mutant prejudice, while not as obvious as in the canon Marvel
universe, still exists, although usually relegated to the status of an
extremist group.But the universal constant of change forces humanity to
act, to find some way to unite and combat the growing threats. Within the
UN Security Council, talks have already begun in earnest to set up a
world-wide peacekeeping force composed of those super-powered beings with
heroic tendencies. Their mission: protect Earth from the supervillains and
from those who would try to subvert the planet for the cause of evil.This
is a world where the supernatural and superpowered hold sway... a world
where heroes protect those less fortunate from the petty whims of
villainy... this is the world of Trials and Triumphs.

creator's RPG world, and thus is a tour through his (sometimes
demented :)) imagination.  Building on Ingvi's World is encouraged:
there are no builder quotas and the MUCK creator intends always to
allow open building.  City areas ready for your imagination to
further augment are available, as are wild lands, and new areas
are easily available on request.  Preybots have been implemented
in the wild lands for those who like to hunt.  IW is a varied place,
with room for the creativity of many minds.  Come build and

WWW         : http://www.fandra.org/
Description :

   We allow player killing, but require roleplay. Fandra offers you a
unique religions system and a beatiful world to explore. Some classes, like
cleric and priestknight, fully depend on chosen god. Following a God gives
additional skills, but makes you depend on your faithfulness, and on status
of your Temple. Temples can be raided by followers of an enemy god, and you
might loose recall and most of your prayers won't work until you re-raid.

   We have unique area set and solid world concept with creation story, map
and such. No Midgaard. You can choose a town to live in.

   We have quests, both automated and provided by immortals. ANSI Colors
are configurable. You can choose a different color for every channel, and
for many events, like someone using a certain skill.

   Mobs and even some items act wise, and there are many quests within our
areas. You won't get bored. Race/Hometown/Class/Religion combinations
provide enough different roles for you to play.

   If you are new to online RPGs, that's the right place to start -
Adventurer's Guild makes it's easy to learn to play. If you are an
expirienced player, and tired of countless stock area bases with no concept,
nothing new to explore and no role to play - Fandra will be a pleasant
surprise for you.

  This MUSH was founded by fanatical Role Players who love Star
Wars and were sick and tired of just how awful all the other Star

of the Star Wars galaxy and present a fantastic enviroment for
fans of RP!

fantastic galaxy. You will not be disappointed. The MUSH is no
longer 'new' its aged and experienced and its always looking for
fresh faces. We've passed the events of the original trilogy and
everything that happens in a Star Wars movie happened in our
timeline. The reset, the 'expanded universe', is up to what our
players make of
it!

  We're not following the direct path of the majority of crappy
novels that are on the market today, but we do pull from them
what is necessary to continue to breath life into the Star Wars
galaxy. Again, this MUSH was designed to be the most realistic
and honest-to-Theme, as well as the most dedicated to bringing to
life an EYE APPEALING appearance.

  Come to Star Wars: Age of Alliances, join the saga as its
meant to be in text form!

Besides the skills and spells available to everyone, our class-system

Upon choosing your profession, you gain access to specialized spells and
skills. There also are numerous guilds, each offering a unique bonus.

Numerous areas, filled with dangerous monsters and quests make this a
challenging place, even for the most experienced players. This makes 
choosing your allies very important: In fact your survival often depends 
upon it.

While death is not a permanent thing for normal charachters, we offer the
more daring players the ability to play a 'hardcore' character. While this
offers several large advantages over normal players, dying means exactly 
that: Your character is gone forever.

Join the struggle and choose your own Fate.

WWW         : http://www.landsofdelusion.com
Description :

 Lands of Delusion at this time (ON THIS PORT) isn't being worked
on. We have another port workin on it. We are bringing, you,
the players a grand unqiue feel. We are currently making more
like Final Fantasy, such as the Materia system working just like
in Final Fantasy VII, except class based. No more stock skill/
spell percent, it's just like the games.
 With this system, you either have the spell or you don't.
Class based meaning all classes can wear the Materia and level
it up, but you can't cast/use the spell/skill unless your say
Black mage for the Fire Materia (containing Fire1-4) or the
Blackbelt for the Kick Materia (containing Kick, Legsweep,
Roundhouse) and that such. These are gained on AP while
having the Materia SOCKETED into your weapon/armor. Each
Weapon/Armor has its own socketing abilities (1-5 slots)
depending on how good/bad the weapon is.
 We have the Triple Triad card game from Final Fantasy VIII,
it also is straight from the game. You can gain cards by
quests, immortal ran quests, or trading/challenging other players
to a game of Triple Triad. This gives players other things to do
other than levelup your character.
 Theres more! We also have a unique world map, non like most
others with areas just tossed here and there, we carefully
thought it out and placed according to storyline progression,
level based and questing purposes.
 Areas are unique and straight from the Final Fantasy games,
meaning RANDOM ENCOUNTERS, but the same monsters and that such
that you encounter on the games.
 Last but sure as **** not least we have clans. Yevon, The Empire,
The Returners, Avalanche, and ShinRa. I also thought about adding
a few extra which I won't state the names just yet. I'll leave that
for opening day. They each have DIVISIONS and RANKS within the clan
non like others just having ranks with DIVISION names within the
rank name...boring! The clans will not open starting out until
I see some ROLEPLAY envolving them and seeing that people will
really take care of the MUD and make it a better place with a
large system of ROLEPLAYING and continuous fun.
 We the staff of LoD have dedicated alot of our time into making
this the most realistic Final Fantasy themed MUD for your benefit
to come, get away from your REAL LIFE. Trade cards, challenge to
card duels, levelup, roleplay, EVEN BREED AND CATCH CHOCOBOS.
 This MUD has a lot to offer. Right now the older version of Lands
of Delusion is up and running, but hopefully soon we will have the
newer version of the game completely balanced out and ready for
players.
 Please, look forward to the new Lands of Delusion version because
I really think this will take all of the other Final Fantasy games
and just really toss them out for good.

    Thanks for reading this.

Description :

  Welcome to Kirganthis and the city of Stonegate, a jewel
of a city in the central plains, a city that was once left
for dead after a decade long war against all of Goblinkind.
Rebuilt stronger and better than its predecessor, the city
stands as a monument to the alliance which turned the war
in favor of the humans, elves, dwarves, and other races who
held the walls and battlements.

  Inside the walls are found the Academie of Magic, where
centuries old research of the arcane is conducted, shops of
all sorts, both mundane and useful, the temple to the old,
and sometimes forgotten, Ancients who once roamed the world
unchecked and unchallenged, not to mention the people of
the town themselves.

  Breathe in the history, revel in the scenery and people,
live another life different from your own.  Every day more
and more of the continent is discovered, more people are
met, and a few more lives are taken, some accidentally and
some quite by purpose.  the city is for the most part safe,
but once one steps outside the massive gates, all is left
completely to chance.

      'To each generation, there is a Chosen One. One girl in all the
world born with the strength and skill to hunt vampires, find them where
they gather and stop the spread of their evil and the swell of their
numbers. She is the Slayer.'

      Since its 1996 debut, Joss Whedon's 'Buffy the Vampire Slayer' has
become one of television's most successful hits, as well as its resulting
spin-off, 'Angel'.  After a rough initiation into Slayerhood, Buffy moved to
Sunnydale, a quiet Californian town located about a two hours drive down the
freeway from her native L.A.. A 'one-Starbucks town', Sunnydale is quite the
downer. There is a significant lack of nightlife, decent shopping and
first-run movies. It also has the highest mortality rate in the nation, and
bizarre events are blamed on 'gangs on PCP' or 'gas leaks'.  As Buffy soon
finds, Sunnydale actually rests on a Hellmouth -- a center of mystical
convergence and hotspot of demonic activity. The city administration
actively moves to aid these cover-ups, unbeknownst to anyone in the
otherwise picturesque town. This leaves the human populace in a perpetual
state of oblivion, having no idea of the terrible danger and precarious
future that Sunnydale faces nightly, save the Slayer and her band of friends
as they fight to protect it.

    Meanwhile, Angel has since left his beloved Buffy's side, heading to
L.A. to fight for his redemption, facing the evils of a town that has been
without a Champion since Buffy's departure.  Evil law firms, vampire nests,
evil warlocks... it all can be found abundantly in L.A..  On a quest to help
the helpless in a city where nothing is as it seems and no one cares, the
only vampire with a soul enlists the help of his allies - and finds just how
evil the City of Angels really is.

    We have recently re-opened, introducing our L.A. grid.  This isn't the
Buffy the Vampire Slayer MUX you remember, it's even better!  Come visit us

Description :

 Final Realms is a multiplayer, online, text-based, role-playing
game in a fantasy setting with a full complement of special 
features: persistent and controllable character development, 
static and interactive quests, cooperative and competitive 
combat, player controlled organizations, a variety of items and
creatures located in a vast world ready to be explored.

Each character selects a race and guild (profession) from a vast
assortment.  Each guild learns from a different variety of
abilities and spells. Players earn titles related to their
development, rank, and player-elected status.

Players may create, organize and expand their own groups that
are dedicated to specific purposes.  There are also many
existing Clans, Groups, Houses and Families that players join,
control, and advance in rank.

Numerous quests populate Final Realms with puzzles, mazes, keys
to find, and doors to unlock.  Artifacts and treasures are
guarded by dragons, demons and other mystical creatures. Many
quests require massive cooperation between skilled characters to
successfully complete. Magical items, spells and abilities are
earned by exploration, brains and brawn.  Special, interactive
quests also take place to shape the Realms' history.

The combat system on Final Realms is highly developed with melee
and missile weapons, a huge variety of magical spells and
healing effects. Each guild has unique abilities that grow as
a player gains experience. Player versus player combat is
allowed and well developed.

Description :

       Berlin: the sprawling, chaotic metroplex where the
only law is that there is no law. The City of Anarchy,
where only the toughest and smartest can hope to survive.
You think you're good, alter? Well, come to Berlin and
prove it, because if you can make it here, you can make it
anywhere. Shadowrunners are in high demand in this 'plex,
what with everyone from the megacorps to the org-crime
syndicates to the gangs, and everyone in between, all vying
for their piece of the pie. But mediocre 'runners don't
last long around here. You wanna stay alive, you gotta be
good, mann.

        Shadowrun Germany MUX is set amid this chaotic yet
lucrative hotbed of the Sixth World, based on the Germany
Sourcebook and incorporating Third Edition rules and 
Expansions. We allow a wide variety of character classes 
restricted or disallowed elsewhere, including metahuman
variants, ghouls, and even shapeshifters. Magical character
slots are available, and other shadowrunner archetypes--
fixers, deckers, riggers, street samurai, mercenaries,
demolitions experts, intrusion specialists, assassins,
melee combat masters, and just about anything else you
could think of--are allowed virtually without restriction.
So come to Berlin, chummer, and see what it's like running
in the darkest shadows to be found in 2061.

EKD Mud features an exciting and unique world to explore.
Players will enjoy a wide variety of classes and races to choose

nobility.

  Characters can also choose to expand their lineage by 
creating bloodlines or further enhance their characters with
our unique meta system. EKD Mud is an incredibly addictive 
and enjoyable experience - you won't be disappointed.

  Other Features: Sound support (MSP), mobprogs, detailed and
varied combat system, automated quests, clans, special events,
experienced player base and a HUGE world to explore. 

  Note: We have recently changed our name to EKD Mud, to 
separate ourselves a bit from the mud currently called 
'Kallisti Mud', formerly 'Legends of Kallisti'.  We are a 
completely separate and independent entity, and it was time
to remove all doubt concerning this. The two may share a 
common root, but are otherwise entirely unconnected.

enjoy; as well as many new area features to make mobs/objects more challenging and

Description :

   Forgotten Weyrs is a game set in the 3rd interval, with no threadfall in 
living memory nor any thread due for at least another hundred years.  It 
has Anne McCaffrey's permission to run as per 'news anne' on the game, and 
is set in a non-canon minor hold (Forsaken) and two non-canon Weyrs (No and 
Who Knows) set in the Western Island chain.  There are currently posted 
crafters but no PC crafthalls, though this could change if enough interest 
develops.  There is an online registration system in place which insures 
that people are familiar with Pern and with the specific timeline.  We would 
rather new players be familiar with the books, especially _Dragonsdawn_ and 
_Moreta_, but do not ask whether they have read the books unless they very 
clearly demonstrate a lack of understanding in their character application.  
Player dragons are allowed with rider and wizard approval.  At this time we 
are not allowing characters to be riders unless they have impressed in a 
hatching on Forgotten Weyrs, though we reserve the right to make exceptions.

WWW         : http://www.winters-edge.com
Description :

  In the First Age of the World, magic and form were one and the
  same. It was a mystical and wondrous time, a time before the
humanoids
  walked the earth. The great dragons were the powers of the
land, roaming and shaping life itself as they saw fit, as if they
were gods. The gods were angered by the presumption of the
dragons... The dragon uprising was crushed before it even began,
the primordial wyrms trapped in a new realm, splitting the magic
from the mundane.

  The Second Age was filled with wonder and glory, though little
  magic. Soon, the races were flourishing under the world that
the dragons once guarded. The dragons plotted, and grew mad with
the influence of the Mists. Their half-wyrmish descendants
unlocked the Mists, and even though the opening was brief, havoc
spread. After time, and with great loss, the mad wyrms were
banished once more, and the Third Age began, with weakened Mists.
Magic flourishes once more on the world, and the time of heroes
has come.

  Winter's Edge is a completely original world. All theme,
  cities, deities, and areas are completely from scratch and
created by the staff here. We are using races, classes, and stats
from 3rd Edition Dungeons and Dragons. Currently the only races
and classes allowed as Player Character(PC) races/classes are the
'standard' races and classes
contained in the 3rd edition Player's Handbook, and a
selection of custom variants on existing races. We are currently
open for beta-testing.

The Four Lands, a world, based loosely on Terry Brooks' Shannara
series, that is dedicated to the most intensive Role-Playing
experience with the feeling of total immersion into a seperate
reality. When you log into The Four Lands you are stepping into
a whole other world. With seven years of development and two
years of being open to the public, this game is the ultimate for
those hard core gamers that are looking for the diamond in the
rough, the sanctuary from frivality, the adrenaline pumping
excitement that can only come from transporting yourself into
another space and time to take on all of the emotions and
experiences of your alter-ego.
 
A realistic yet challenging skill system that reflects the
realistic way in which people learn, allowing players to choose
a class merely as their inborn talents with the ability to gain
the skills of all the other classes. A world that reflects
reality with flowing rivers and gravity, a weather system that is
different from the warm sunny south to the cold, snowy northland
mountains. With carriages, horses, saddles and reins, the 25000+
original room world is ready for exploration. With a dynamic
economy that involves the miner who mines the metals for the
smelter to create better metals who sells it to the blacksmith to
forge into a fine weapon or piece of armor to be sold for a cost
based on cost of material, craftsmanship, and uniqueness.
Everything from shoes to loaves of bread can be made by the
player run economy.

Every player should eventually have a story or plot that
at least partially focuses on their character.
 
So, why don't you come take a look? Ephemera is a small
game, just now opening up to the public, but beliefs are
strong and 'old gaming styles' are firmly clung onto.

WWW         : http://nebmedes.o-r-g.org:8000/
Description :

 Nebmedes is a roleplaying game set in the fantastic city of the same name.  It
is the capital of the High Kingdom of Ta-shamerew, the Empire.  We've drawn
from ancient Egyptian culture and mythology to form the core of the world, the
pantheon, the architecture, the food and dress, but we have also added in
touches from our own imagination.  The game is not historically accurate; it's
not Egypt, though it is similar.

We focus strongly on roleplaying over rollplaying.  This isn't to say that we
ignore the system and run things free form, we wouldn't be playing with a
system at all if that is what we were aiming at.  What that does say is that
we have set up XP so that a pure roleplay character will advance as quickly as
an 'adventurer'.  We have a strong focus on plot before killing things;
politics, investigation and discovery all take precedence over 'Dead Monster!'
and yet, with the dice one bad roll won't destroy a player unless they've
placed themselves in a stupid position.  Dice are secondary to roleplaying,
but in some conflict resolution, the dice are there for a reason. We've worked 
hard to allow the players a useful position in the world besides
as 'adventuring heroes'.  For example, we have modified the rules on crafting
and masterwork items to allow crafters to do their job in a reasonable amount
of time and we do not now, nor are we ever planning on having 'vendors' on the
grid.  There is also the noble court, a unique chance for players to get
involved with the politics of the city and actually influence what happens
there.  This is a chance for PCs to involve themselves in the game to make
decisions and see the impact on the world.

Players can make a sage, a craftsman, an adventurer, a politician, a soldier,
a hunter or anything else that strikes their fancy, and all have a place and a
use within the world.  It's D&D, yes, but it's not a MUD.

Heavily upgrading in progress main concern is a haven for

Anything goes with certain restrictions no means no,
no harassment of players who don't want it, no spoiling
anyone elses fun and no rape unless its purely roleplay
and agreed by both parties.

In this world of politically correct subject matter I feel
there is a place for people who are open and happy about
there sexuality and want to explore the subject within a

Description :

  The Staff of 'The Third Age' would like to welcome you to 
our MUD, which is now open after a fashion.  This version
of the -OldSchoolMUD 1.0- is based on Mikkimud 1.0, and 
will grow using it as a foundation.  The mud is in an
alpha stage at the moment, so expect some things to work 
erratically while others are already being worked on.  We 
are inviting our players to begin roleplaying and 
developing thier characters in the Wheel of Time theme we 
currently offer.  Over the next several months, we will be 
working hard not only to make this a fun community to be 
apart of, but we will also be working to make it more 
readily adaptable for 'Code = IC' philosophy.  Because of 
this, we will be undergoing changes  and balance 
adjustments, we ask that our players stand by us in this 
effort.  No one will lose any of the work they put into 
thier characters.  There will be countless opertunities 
for rewards in helping us refine the current code system.

Description :

Tarmon Gai'don is the home of a new Wheel of Time Mud code base,
'WoT' based on ROM2.4b6 and offers the following:

. All-new, 100% original areas designed exclusively to fit the Wheel of Time
  world.  Possibly the most book-accurate on the net.  Desc's 5-15 lines long.
. All 'Wheel of Time' races are supported. You won't find any elves or dwarves 
  here.  Humans and Ogier are open, with Fades, Trollocs and Draghkar slated 
  for the future.
  Character Generation support: 3 classes, 20+ sub-classes & talents and over
  100  homelands/clans/steddings to optimize individual and unique characters.
. Completely original guild system, featuring potential for over 2 dozen
  playable guilds.  Guilding is not mandated to role-play.
. Role-play environments ranging from 100% IC areas, quests, faires, and other
  events.
. A completely IC channeling system, designed to follow the Wheel of Time 
  One Power as close as possible.  Weaves and flows are dependent upon your
  strength in the power. Overchanneling can lead to burning out.
. Realistic submission/ player death code (PK death) to disuade useless PK. 
. an intriguing `introduction` system, so if you have never met someone, you
  truly don`t know them. Players appear as `An Andoran`, etc. until Greeted. 
. A completely original and amusing optional WoT newbie area,
  along with newbie friendly players and immortals.

Description :

 Mystic Dimensions Legends is currently being modified and
tested.  Much of the coding needs players who are willing
to donate their time and ideas to help in furthering the
progress of the realm.  Though player wipes can be
discouraging, at this time they are necessary to ensure
that the realm meets it's maximum capability.  We encourage
players who which to be a part of the construction of a new
realm to join us.

The overall goal of the realm is to offer players who need
a challenge that is above and beyond what most other realms
offer, a place to meet their needs.

Due to real life work situations the realm is in stasis
mode until reality allows me a time to further advancement.
Please view the website, or email me if you have an
interest in helping to further the realms progress.

Description :

 Jusenkyo Mordor is neither set in Jusenkyo, nor Mordor.
Despite the inaccuracy of the name, it is still a
highly-unique gameworld, with the focus entirely on
RP.
 
The setting is on the floating isles of Eraniss,
located near the Nexus, a point which is near many
universes, some of which the various player characters
hail from.
 
Eraniss is a tumultous place, with imported technology
beginning to spread, native magic prevalent, and
imported magic not uncommon. It is into this place the
 
new arrival enters, having been forcibly removed from
their home by the Nexus, and made subject to undesired
physical changes by the chaotic magic of the Nexus.
 
The setting is that of a world overrun by others from
outside: people, demons, and strange creatures. Some
with the desire to do good, others with the will for
power. And sometimes, the Nexus, the chaotic thing
which dominates the nature of the world and does not
let those outsiders die, will change slightly,
adapting new things into it.
 
And it is into this world the new character arrives.

   The Gathering is one of the oldest talkers still running.
It is based around groups rather than rooms and to improve
the experience, users can be in several groups at the same
time.  This enables you to chat in one of the public groups,
chat privately with friends or loved ones and discuss your
favourite band with a group of fans.

Unlike most talkers, there are no staff to manage
interpersonal disputes.  Instead, users are given the power
to protect themselves from verbal attack - even going as far as
being able to ban other users.

Combined with both these features are all the standard facilities     
you expect from a modern talker - mail, news, games, ANSI color - 
making it a fun and enjoyable play to chat for everyone.

Description :

 GD2K is based upon the comic book series 'Gold Digger' 
by Fred Perry. Gold Digger is a mix of fantasy, action-
adventure, comedy, and many other things. The main
characters include an Indiana Jones type adventurer, her 
adopted were-cheetah sister, the clone they accidentally 
created who is a mix of the both of them; an alien from 
another world; and an eight-year-old boy who is a genius at 
genetics and has created his own three-person army 
consisting of a ninja, a magic-user, and a genetically 
enhanced brawler. The adventurer, one Gina Diggers, is the 
daughter of an arch-mage father from Earth and a master 
armswoman/adventurer from the magical realm of Jade. Her 
sister Britanny is the last surviving were-cheetah, rescued 
by Gina's father from the brutal were-cheetah/were-wolf war 
21 years ago, and brought back to Atlanta with his family.

Gold Digger also includes leprechauns, troll archmages, 
harpies, evil sentient time-travelling dogs, Altantis, 
Shangra-La, were-creatures of many different kinds, and 
much more. 

Information on how to get a character is available on the

WWW         : http://genesis.tekno.chalmers.se/
Description :

   Genesis is the original LPMud, though little remains of
the stuff from the early days. The emphasis of the mud is
to be a challenging game. Themes includes Tolkien, Dragon
Lance and many others. The world is strictly medieval
fantasy based.

   There are many features that sets it apart from most
other muds. One of the most enjoyable aspects is the
interesting and ever-changing interaction between different
guilds. Relations range from alliance to uneasy truce with
the occasional outbreak of war.

Another special feature are events, that are planned and
executed by a special team of wizards from time to time.

   Being a newbie is a struggle on Genesis. You are a puny
weakling in a world that is quite hostile. It is up to
you to explore very carefully, or find someone stronger
to show you the ropes.

   Wizardhood is by application. We are always happy if
skilled coders and storytellers want to join us.

Genocide is not a typical mud; rather, it is a competitive
24-hour wargame.  Players compete in wars that go on 
constantly.  Levels are gained by killing other players in a 
variety of different war types, including team and non-team.  
Currently, most serious play takes place in leagues where 
teams are drafted and matches are played each week; smaller 
pickup games occur throughout the remainder of each week.

Description :

MUDII is one of only two sites in the world hosting the latest version of 
MUD, the very first multi-player adventure game. MUD1 or EssexMUD (as the 
original MUD is now known as) was developed by Richard Bartle & Roy Trubshaw 
in 1978 at Essex University, England. Since 1978 MUD has been in constant
development resulting in a highly original and slick game that can be played
here today.

MUDII is a MUD that is set in a timeless alternative reality. This is a 
world where you can be who you want when you want. The community at MUDII is
large and very friendly, they are always willing to welcome and help out
newbies. Quests, Houses (guilds), competitions, events, mud-related online
magazines and numerous associated websites are all part and parcel of this
incarnation of MUD.

MUDII is run by Muddled Games Ltd. which was formed in 2001 to run the game
for the community that previously played on Wireplay. MUD2 had been running 
on Wireplay since August 1997 until the game was closed down there.

As well as the pay per play system a low monthly subscription fee is
available. New players get a free 6 hours to get going and there is a free 
happy hour available nightly.

WWW         : None
Description :

 Beauty was originally loosely based on the BDSM books by Anne
Rice titled 'Sleeping Beauty'. However, it has drastically changed
& very little has to do with the books at all. It is a fantasy
place for RP with variences in sci-fi technology and a feudal type
of society encouraging BDSM type of play/RP. Beauty chargen does
not restrict race or abilities-most of everything is up to the
player's RP ability. We try to accommodate all players here. We do
not enforce BDSM play, or any other kind of play, in OOC area. On
the grid, you are likely to see public BDSM displays.
 
The premise is simple: A magical island has an evil ruler,
Masters/Mistresses and slaves. I'll leave the rest up to your
imagination. If you want to come and be a furry, warrior, wizard,
dragon, cyborg, etc...you are welcome. The island is timeless so
there are a variety of  races/types/creeds in play and everyone is
also welcome to just come and hang out at the OOC Lounge. So
come to Beauty and make it your home. It's a beautiful and fun
place to be.

Description :

Arcadia is a Diku-based ROM derivative PKill MUD, with characters being  
protected from PK until level 8.

The creation system is very newbie-friendly (though ANSI color is
suggested) and we have an enhanced array of beginning races available.
There are two levels of remortality (and more) for those who reach the
maximum mortal levels, with extra races and classes available to them.

Politics and role-play figure into the game with clans, sects, cartels,
and guilds -- and we've introduced private housing player characters
may purchase within their home cities, or rent within the more urban
centers (character homes are, generally, inviolate and save any items
in them through quit-outs and reboots).

Arcadia has many new and original areas, and we're expanding all the
time with new areas, new code, and new classes.

The citizens of Arcadia invite you to come enjoy the Lands and to meet
and make some new friends.

Description :

   Curiosity is a powerful drive that can bring great wealth and power.
But be careful that you don't awaken the Evil One in your searching;
He sleeps but lightly and his temper is vile. Only 500 years have 
passed since the last confrontation, we pray you let there be another 
500 years of peace before the terror returns....

   ShadowMUD's varied lands spread across the vast continent of Caspia
and into the Walgor Sea: icy wastes, wide open plains, swamps,
deserts, and jungles hold many different cities and races. The face 
of the world evolves over time with the inevitable changing of history, 
and partly in ways molded by the adventurers of the realm. Over almost 
a decade, these changes have been to the cities, the geography and 
the townsfolk, and also to the adventurers of the realm and their 
careers. There is a lot of variation among the classes available to 
adventurers, and within each class there are many different abilities 
a character may learn. 

   In addition to the classes that guide one's adventuring career,
there are guilds, each run almost completely by players and sponsored
by one Immortal, that offer significant roleplaying opportunities, 
and can provide a tightly-knit group of friends. The realm has several
full-blown quests, all but one of which are optional, and numerous
mini-quests that are all optional. There are many places to explore,
unique monsters to find, and deeds you may commit that can change how
the townsfolk of various places respond to your character. Gather
enough adventuring experience, exploration, deed-doing and questing,
unique kills and other general adventuring prowess, and you may become
a Legend of ShadowMUD.

 HogwartsMOO is one of the first Harry Potter-inspired roleplaying
games, set originally in the early 1900's but now entering the 1920's
on a 4:1 timescale (a term corresponds to seventeen weeks).

Our theme is non-canon, capturing the charm of Wizarding society
without Rowling's storyline. None of the novels' feature characters (or
relatives) will ever appear in our world. Instead, key roles are held by
player-created characters. Our focus is Hogwarts School of Witchcraft
and Wizardry, but we have an extremely flexible creation system,
allowing players to have multiple characters in roles ranging from infant
to student (in any year) to professional adult in any of several dozen
currently defined magical careers (and we'll always accept suggestions).

Our goal is fun, realistic roleplay: we offer extensive help systems and
infrastructure (such as personal logging, reposes-on-demand, House
points in hourglasses, etc.) and detailed areas such as London, Diagon
Alley, Hogwarts itself, Hogsmeade, and the Forest. However, we have no
coded spells or levels: we trust our players to roleplay responsibly.

Please visit our webpage, check the Online Characters listing, read a few
logs, and explore our world. Newbies and veterans alike are welcome!

Description :

   On December 24, 2004, out of the sight of mortals, a
castastrophe of epic proportions disrupted the supernatural
world in a violent and decisive way.  Manchester, New
Hampshire awoke the next day changed, and with it much of 
way of things to come.  Though the initial rumblings have
faded, their causes are still a source of mystery to anyone
who knew what happened. Down underneath the surface lurk a
lot of dark answers, a promise to be fulfilled, and a lot
more questions....  

Telling the good guys from the bad guys is not easy, even as
the state motto 'Live Free or Die' is scrawled in graffiti 
on overpasses and disused billboards.  

We are a writer's chronicle, encouraging collaborative
fiction among our players which we support through our short
story list.  Granite is a haven for those weary of storyless,
unfulfilling games with wholesale PK and other social ills.
Come join our game community and experience some of the best.

of the galaxy's opposing good and evil forces is once again put into play. Along with 
the struggle and hope, comes chaos and strife with the emergence of the Sith. It

Description :

 The Eternal Fantasy is a mud based on the popular game
series 'Final Fantasy' by Squaresoft.  

The mud offers players a growing list of races, including
Human, Elf, Moogle, Half-Elf, Half-Lunar, Kelban and Dwarf.
Also, players can alternate between over 60 classes -- 
including knights, paladins, ninjas, assassins, archmagi,
thief, and treasure hunters -- through a system borrowed
from Final Fantasy Tactics.  This allows players to select 
both a primary class and a secondary class, combining the 
abilities of both.

Four of Squaresoft's most popular games (Final Fantasy 1, 
Final Fantasy 4, Final Fantasy 5 and Final Fantasy 6) are 
combined in an already large and constantly growing network 
of worlds with an overall plot that links all of them.

Although it is currently still under Gamma testing, players 
and ancients (wizards) are newbie friendly, quests are 
plentiful, and there is much discovering to be made.  
Players are welcome to submit ideas, as well as contribute 
in world wide quests run by the administration. For the avid
Final Fantasy fan, or just one looking for a mud to play, 
this game is definately something to consider playing.

Description :

   Grimne is the ultimate incarnation of a violent, hack-n-slash mud.
Filled with stat hungry, equipment hoarding players, blood and carnage
are all that matter.  With a shaman that sells stats to higher level
characters, and a storage room in which items can be stored
indefinately for a small fee, there is an ongoing competetion as to
who is the 'best' in each class.  Damage by each player can be
logged, and the more successful one is at inflicting punishment upon
mobs, the more one is respected.  Experience, gold and equipment are
the ruling forces, and power is the ultimate reward.  Newbies, however,
are not forgotten.  An extensive newbie-guide is among the
equipment received upon character creation, including such basics
as how to talk and where to go.  In addition, certain mobs will cast
beneficial spells upon low level characters, and there is a
newbie channel and a constantly updated list of 'newbie helpers'
to whom one can ask questions.  If you wish to do away with all
of the fluff of some of the overdone muds and get right down
to the honesty of pure violence and greed, come to Grimne.  You
won't be disappointed.

  In the beginning, there was Altrag, from whose hand flows 
the wellspring of Life. And in his loneliness in the Void
he wrought the mighty Nimroetil, the Crystal of Creation, 
and wielding it, he created the Abyss. Yet among his 
disciples there was a jealousy. Between the Titans, 
Aleister and Stormreaver, there was a hatred. War swept 
across the Abyss, and Nimroetil was broken, and it's shards 
lost. Yet its memory, and the promise of infinite power, 
lived on in the hearts of Mortals. And now, even as the 
world recovers from battle, clans begin to form, to search 
for the shards, because the enemy must not reunite 
Nimroetil. At Any Cost!.

 The Abyss will soon be back, with many features including:
 - A complex and strategic combat system
 - A classless, skill-based advancement system
 - Player-run clans with player-built HQs
 - A completely original world
 - A powerful mob scripting language

 We are currently looking for dedicated builders to help bring the Abyss to life.

 Terminus Faire is where tourist, merchants, and others come together to

shadows you feel the eyes of something watching. Insidious laughter fills the
air, a horrible mocking laughter that sends shivers up your spine and leaves
your legs frozen in abject terror.  The air pressure in the room drops 
alarmingly as the massive creature in the shadows begins to fill its lungs.
Your brain cries out for you to run but your legs refuse to respond. Suddenly
a brilliant light flares before you, revealing the form of a massive dragon
practically filling the space; it is the last you see before the flames 
roaring from the creatures mouth engulf you, and then there is only 
darkness... 

  This is just a small part of the world of Dragon's Gate, though it may

and holds many surprises for you. Dragons Gate is a massive text based world

Description :

   Harshlands is a roleplay intensive, skills-based MUD set on the island
of Harn (Columbia Games).  Standard 'hack and slash' play is seriously
dissuaded, with levels, classes and experience points non-existent.
Players can choose to pursue careers, including herbalist, journeyman
craftsmen, soldier, guide, criminal and law enforcer.  Players proving
to be skilled and dedicated are offered choices that include shop
ownership, master level craftsmanship, nobility and many advanced
professions.  For those unfamiliar with Harn, it is a low-magic world
based loosely on a composite of 9th-14th century Britain.  The game
world includes over 16,000 original rooms in smoothly integrated and
universally consistant zones, ten deities, five human ethnic and
cultural groups, and three non-human races selectable by players of
proven ability.  While the thrust and focus of the game is serious
roleplay, the world remains a deadly and harsh environment, where life
is risky and death is permanent.

"While trying to sail over the mediterranean sea you got lost, and
finally your ship grounded on an offshore barrier reef. The result
is simple, here you are on an island, the inhabitants live the
ancient roman way, still hoping to be rescued.
If that happened to you hours ago, weeks or years, you are here now,
and have to live in this world with mixed ancient cultures, weird
rites and slavery...."

SPQR is a free, online, text-based game with a unique BSDM theme. It
is for adults only, but it is not a game about sex. The player
seeking a hastened sexual encounter within SPQR has missed its
purpose, for SPQR is a roleplaying game about the slavery lifestyle.
Slavery is its theme, but personal slavery is optional.

Each new character begins life marooned but free. Throughout life,
a character may either be trained as a slave or cultivate enough
standing to become the owner of slaves. A character may even learn
the particular trade of the cleric, dungeonmaster, guard, innkeeper,
merchant, trainer, or perhaps some new, yet unknown path. All this
depends upon the aspirations of the player.

Because a strong fantasy roleplaying environment is desired,
roleplaying is mandatory within SPQR. Multiplaying and character-
sharing are forbidden, though a single, alternate character can be
obtained on a conditional basis.

Weather patterns change seasonally. Room descriptions vary at night.
Personal descriptions may include multiple levels of clothing to
reflect the detail along various stages of dress, customized
according to the whim of the player. An extremely advanced,
directable emoting system is available to assist the enterprising
roleplayer at times when the stock emoting commands are found
wanting. Money acquired during the game can be spent on custom items,
room rental, slave rental, and various other sorts of player-driven
transactions.

Online help, website help, a player newsboard, an optional newbie
channel, and a friendly playerbase are all at hand to help 
familiarize new players.

Description :

4 Dimensions is set at a time after a massive nuclear war has caused 
great rifts in the Time Warp of Universe. Due to those rifts, 
generally known as 'Time Traps', you can travel freely between 
different time periods. Some enterprising people have set up a 
Travel Agency, making it easier for adventurous Travellers to explore 
the different Dimensions of Time.

There are 4 main 'Worlds' that you can visit; Pre Historic, Medieval, 
Old West and Future, each with 100% unique zones - you won't find any 
stock areas in 4D. This makes our mud especially interesting for 
those that like the extra challenge of exploring and solving Quests. 
Even our Mud School is customized, with 4 grades (one for each 
Dimension) and a unique 'Quest Academy' at the top, teaching some of 
the tricks of mudding, that usually only very experienced players 
know about.

At present there are over 180 zones, more than 70000 rooms and over 
hundred built-in Quests of varying difficulty. Many of our long time 
players build for us, so the world is growing at a steady rate. With 
the Quest prizes you can buy some of our special 'features' like 
crash-proof houses, and personalized equipment, pets, mounts and 
vehicles. 

4D is and will always be totally free to play, although we have more 
features than many Pay-to-Play Muds. Our remort and skill system is 
very advanced, allowing you to continuously improve your character. 
The full potential of the Game only unfolds as you play it, but 
already in Mud School you'll get a taste of what to expect later on.

So come and enjoy one of the most developed and original free Muds on 
the net! Some of the content in the zones is a bit 'mature', so this 
is not a mud for the very young or very prudish.

the Morlocks, its the evil that consumes the underbelly of New York. And for the 
Brotherhood itself, its the Friends of Humanity and the schemers of the world.

After a tragic accident several years ago, the X-Men and the high school students have 
fallen under the wing of Magneto, a close friend of their former mentor. Established 
in New York, they attend the Massachusetts Academy, an Upper West Side boarding school 
with one of the best reputations in the world. As each group grows more organized, 
change comes in shocking and new ways. With several forces scheming in the backgrounds, 
each team will have their hands full in the quest for survival, and ultimately, balance.

WWW         : http://www.stormsoftime.com
Description :

We offer our players the ability to build their own castle which can
be turned into a clanhall. Clans are entirely player run. The mud
has been designed to not need any immortals, and even has a suicide
command for the rare occasion you get stuck in a no exit room with
no way to get out, as well as morgues to buy your corpse in case you
cannot get back to your corpse.

Every area has one or more quests players can complete for
equipment. Our mob prog support is one of the best, all areas
combined holding over 80.000 lines of script code. Finding and 
completing the unique quests will be a lot of fun for those who
like a challenge.

There are many classes to choose from, each with their own strong
set of skills, as well as many races. Each character can
reincarnate, if they desire, up to 10x, with a choice of stronger
races available in each incarnation. The 'auto' command can be used
to cast spells automatically at double speed, making spell casters
as easy to play as fighters.

We feature a VT102 interface to replace the traditional prompt,
allowing good gameplay with a basic telnet client such as putty.

The areas are connected with a huge system of roads which can be
automatically walked down using the travel command, combined with
the help file showing a world map, as well as road signs, most
areas will be easy to find.

See you there :)

  Starwars Imperial Awakening (started Jan 2002) is 2.5 years after Return Of The Jedi.
The Empire, run by Grand Admiral Thrawn, is working to not only pull the Empire
together, but to win the battle against the Rebel Alliance. Princess Leia, Captain
Margo Wethers, and General Crix Madine are dealing with a vast number of victories as
the Rebel Alliance, under the direction of the New Republic Council, push towards
their goal of forming the New Republic.

Recently, and not too long after a shield which trapped all on the planet of Corellia
was brought down, the Corellian Sector declared independence and Sullust has become a
battle ground as the Rebels and Imperials battle for control. With both a space
platform over Sullust as well as an ISD patrolling the Sullust sector, the Rebels are
starting to have trouble adding forces and getting supplies to Sullust.

Yet another problem for those citizen who simply want to live their lives in peace is
the Pirates and Hutt organizations that work for themselves or hire out to the Empire.
Greed, Power, and Crime are always a problem for those hard working people. Smugglers,
Bounty Hunters, and other dangerous positions within the galaxy are never far from
sight.

BESIDES OUR HUMUNGOUS AREAS LIST, explore the different possibilities 
of character creation.  Multi-classing is allowed, however not always 
necessary.  New codes have been introduced to extend advantage to 
pure classes.  Dual-classes and comboskills are now underway, 
allowing players to enhance their abilities beyond two basic classes.
Whether you are self-sufficient or dependent on clannies and a tank, 
all characters serve a purpose.  

ALWAYS LOOKING OUT FOR NEWBIES, forever challenging oldbies, our 
questing system allows all levels to have a crack at the exclusive 
quest equipment stores of the immortals of HexOnyx.  From PVP to 
group-run quests to global modifications of load, regeneration, and 
damage rates, something out-of-the-ordinary is happening almost 
every day on HexOnyx.

COME CHECK OUT HEXONYX MUD, a CircleMUD since its metamorphosis 
from Five Worlds.  As a home to some of the builders of CircleMUD's

(coders, builders and questors) strive to surpass its self-raised 
standards.  Come to HexOnyx -- explore where fantasy and science 
fiction has taken us from the past all the way to the far future.

Description :

The Hollow World

The planet of the Known World is not a solid ball like our Earth is. In fact
it's hollow. A tiny sun hangs in the center of the hollow, and vast polar 
openings permit travel between the inner and outer worlds. The interior 
landscape is called the 'Hollow World', a place of acient mystery.

The polar openings leading into the Hollow World are so huge that their 
cruvature is very, very gradual. That, combined with the fact that these
regions are perpetually shrouded in fog, means that people can travelfrom the
outer world to the inner (or vice-versa) without being aware of it.

The interior sun sheds daylight at all times in the Hollow World; night never
falls, and creatures susceptible to sunlight (such as vampires)  are rare
indeed.

The interior world has long been hidden from the outer world- the few 
outer-world explores who have found it have either died there, stayed there 
willingly, or returned without publicizing their discovery. To this day, the
existence of the Hollow World is not generally known in the outer world.

Description :

  Feltain is a MUD that was made with one thing in mind-- A 
rich RPG world that you can spend hours lost in. We 
strongly are based on a game that can run itself without
immortals stepping in/running things. 

Feltain 1 was a total Rom MUD. Later on it was decided that 
we would be written from the ground up from scratch. We
later decided that we liked many of the features that made
us enough like other MUD's to be playable to experienced
MUDders, which we are made for. We have since went through
versions 2, 3, and are now working on 4. Feltain was
written from nothing and has had excepts from Rom inserted
into it. It's stable and unique.

We offer more than just unique code. We have unique 
gameplay. Our entire world is a mix of computer drafting
and human influence from the builders to balance stats and 
abilities on equipment. We offer traditional areas like 
most muds, however, we also have a worldmap such as the 
ones seen on final fantasy and other RPG titles. We have a 
modest amount of levels, 41, which must be attained 3 
times. Each time you retain the skills and spells you had 
in your previous class. It makes for interesting gameplay.

Come play with us and see why you'll never need another MUD!

pirates, mercenaries, and spies.

HoloTrek welcomes both experienced and new roleplayers to

good roleplaying skills will find their characters growing
in power and influence.

 It is a time of unrest for the galaxy. The Galactic Civil War
has ended, but the strain that it caused still weighs heavy. War
may be over but the fighting continues - at times just as fierce
and deadly as during the height of the Rebel insurrection.
 
The fledgling New Republic is making small steps at restoring
some order to the vast regions decimated by conflict. Bringing
together countless unique species and civilizations, under the
flag of peace and harmony rather than conquest and submission is
a task harder than anyone would have believed.
 
The Empire is a remnant of its once glorious military. Forced to
surrender great amounts of territory to better protect itself,
but they have not surrendered their dedication to the ideal
crafted out of the evils of Palpatine.
 
Independents have a greater vision of the galaxy now. Smuggling
remains a strong source of income and many believe that it will
expand even more now. Pirates operate in the relative open. With
both the New Republic and Empire strained beyond compare,
pirates are capable of picking and choosing their targets with
little fear of governmental retaliation. The Civil War may have
ended. But the galaxy has yet to see a time of peace. Conflict
is all anyone knows, and they will not see it erased so easily.
 
The possibilities are endless. This is a time for all to make a
difference from the smallest of characters, to the leaders of
vast governments. Everyone has a place - and each place is
unique in its necessity.

Based off of the Anita Blake novels by Laura K. Hamilton, is the City that Never 
Sleeps. Playing in New York City in the year 2007 is a group of great players. 
Humans, Vampires, Werewolves, and the Pride, all are forced to live together in a 
city where there isn't much free space.

It is possible to have tea with the werewolves, although the local Ulfric prefers 
coke. You could go dine with Vampires, just try to ignore that they don't eat the 
food on their plates. The Leopards own one of the hottest clubs in town and you 
dress formally when going to it. Course, they are trying to hide themselves, public 
sentiment never goes with the preters.

City that Never Sleeps is an 18 and up game. Visit our website at http://ctns.mushpark.com

Description :

Iconoclast MUD is now in its 6th continuous year of operation, making us one
of the longest-running Cyberpunk/Gothic-themed MUDS on the Internet. We've
long been one of the top Sci-Fi RP MUDS listed on the search engines, and a
significant portion of our players have been with us since the beginning for
that very reason.

Iconoclast is set at the dawn of the 22nd Century, and is based around the
people and events associated with the free city of New Aurora. Genetic
alteration, cybernetic enhancements, neural interfaces, excessive violence,
corporate control, rampant gang and cult activity and aworldwide Matrix are
accepted as the norm. The 6000+ room Iconoclast world itself is 100%
original, and designed to be realistic without being detrimental to play.
The focus is on quality, not quantity.

Our customized code (a Circle 3.0 derivative) encourages role-playing while
allowing a more traditional hack-and-slash style of play for those who enjoy
that. Combat works differently than on other MUDS; there are no levels or
experience points as such, but there is plenty of room for self-directed
advancement to high levels of power and influence.

And those are the players!  

IgorMud players fight terrible monsters and hideous
creatures, then lounge about in our famous Spice Club, 
or their own private rooms, or take in a Shitar concert,
and brag of their kill and eat spicy kabobs and drink
firebreathers with friends, guild mates, and team members.
As they become more powerful and skilled they even build
their own castles and invite friends to visit!

IgorMud is place of great adventure, a small virtual town
with characters of all sorts.  We have a fantastic newbie
school and areas for our newcomers, and intimate families
and friendly clubs.  We have six guilds, and weapon
specializations (which come in handy when fighting the
trolls, the klingons, the vampires, the horrible Big
Potato, Tigger, the lemming invasion!)

IgorMud is home to players from around the world, not only
from Sweden, but from the Netherlands, Great Britain, the
United States, Australia, and many other places. Come join
us; we have a place for you.

Telnet      : puzzleboxmuck.org 8890 [69.61.22.227]
WWW         : http://www.puzzleboxmuck.org
Description :

Puzzlebox is a science fiction/transhuman/"postfurry" MUCK set in a 
dreamlike city on a cryptically hyperintelligent megastructure. 
Most characters are furries with futuristic trappings, but all sorts 
of strange cosmic beasties abound. Food, shelter, and even healthcare
are available at the blink of an eye, so there's nothing left to fight
over except for ideas -- and no way to fight over them except for art 
and seduction.

Puzzlebox is different from many other MU*'s in that it takes place in
a richly developed original world, but it's still fairly freeform and
loosely regulated. While we hope you'll find our players to be fun and
friendly, we also pride ourselves on investing serious thought and, 
more importantly, emotion into our virtual lives. At its best, 
Puzzlebox is also a social experiment, a work of collaborative art, a
philosophical conundrum, a laboratory for identity play, and 
sometimes a bit of group therapy. :)

Membership is by application only -- intellectually curious,
open-minded people who play well with others, daydreamers and
romantics preferred. Please visit our webpage or email 
functionxor@gmail.com for more information.

Mud         : Shattered Sanity
Code Base   : [GodWars] Originally LoW4, Extremely Heavily Modified.
Telnet      : sanity.xtramud.net 8500 [82.113.130.216]
WWW         : None
Description :

        Shattered Sanity is a MUD where players kill 
eachother for status. Unlike most status-based muds, 
however, in Shattered Sanity, status doesn't provide huge 
benefits so that the top players are nearly elite. 
Instead, our combat system is based off of knowledge and 
skill, and our classes were mathematically balanced long 
before they were implemented into the mud. 

            We also have a unique equipment system, where 
instead of mindlessly questing for hours, (questing is 
available, for those who do like it) they mine for ore and 
gemstones, with which they create their equipment. This 
equipment can then be quested further. We also have unique 
quest zones, where players can gain amazing equipment 
amoung other things. 

            The mud was designed in a manner that allows a 
new player to come in and get up to speed fast rather than 
having to spend months to catch up to the big players.  
The newbie eq is more than adequate to get started and 
fully custom eq is not too painful to obtain.  The goal we 
have achieved is a balanced mud that anyone can relatively 
quickly get up to speed and jump into the pk mix. On the 
vast majority of muds out there these days the victor in 
pk matches is determined by 1 of  2 things, who has the 
most hours building their character or who has the class 
that is the most overpowered. We've shifted away from both 
of these things and left pk largely up to how the fight is 
conducted. The mud is unique in many other aspects.. come 
check us out for yourselves, you won't be disappointed!

WWW         : http://vore.got-game.org/VoregottenRealm/
Description :

Somewhere in Brittany (France) is a magical forest, the forest
of Broceliande, home of Merlin, the druid and enchanter. It is
well known that Merlin is used to travel through time, but what
is unknown of the crowd is that Merlin did setup a magic cave
acting like a portal leading to various worlds and epochs...
There is one thing in common to the worlds that this cave allow
to reach: in these worlds, death is usually not a permanent
status and most of the ones who perish by accident do resurrect
after a while. It's a good thing actually, because the said
worlds are small and closed, very few of their inhabitants being
able to escape them... and food is rare, leading to a merciless
competition for survival where the predators try to feed on the
preys...

Voregotten Realm is a vore-themed free-form role-playing MUCK,
but it also offers a BDSM-biased area (the Slavers' Island) and
the macrophiles and microphiles are welcome too (specific
commands are implemented for them and a specific area is being
built).
As far as vore is concerned, you are welcome to RP any kind of
vore you want: soft, mild, hard, gory, cooking, consensual or
not, sexual or not... anything !
As for the characters' races, all are welcome: humans, furries,
scalies... anything fancying you is fair game (we encourage
creativity and imagination).
The MUCK offers medieval fantasy, contemporary and futuristic /
sci-fi settings, therefore suiting anyone's needs.

Voregotten Realm provides a complete and coherent set of
commands, as well as some unique features, to be discovered on
its website... :-)

It is a very challenging role-playing environment. Imagine a

most of whom would murder you given the chance.
Now imagine that they're starving, irradiated, and angry.
Add to that hideous, unthinkable abominations that are
the product of irresponsible genetics research and
generations of radiation poisoning and pollution. Now
imagine that multinational corporations are the only
organizations cuthroat enough to have come out of
the collapse of civilization with any real collective
power, and that there are now no restrictions on them
using that power however they like.
There are so many ways to die here, and thanks to the
corp's technology, you can keep coming back and
experience each and every one of them.
Not even suicide can get you out of hell.

WWW         : http://jhoira.kyndig.com
Description :

  Once a land ruled by dragons, giants, and powerful
immortals, one millennium later the power of magic has been
replaced by technology and a powerful corporation pulls
political strings from behind the scenes.  A terrible
industrial accident creates a time rift joining the two eras
of the world of Jhoira together.  Now the ways of magic are
returning to the land of the future and time travelers
attempt to alter the past with seemingly no affect.
However, no one knows for sure since all records of the
centuries between have disappeared.

Scourge of Time is mainly a hack and slash mud with optional
player killing and roleplaying.  There are 401 mortal
levels, separated into 4 tiers.  Once the remort area is
written, players will be able to obtain superhero and legend
levels once they have 3 remorts.  Along the way players may
enter challenges (rebirth/reawakening/renewal) where they
can gain new spells and skills for their class or (with an
etl penalty) gain groups more suited for other classes.

We have recently added a casino and a new item type, 'precious
gems', that can improve the stats on equipment.

WWW         : http://None
Description :

 There's nothing I can truly say about this mud that will make
you realize how different it is from other muds, but let me
try. First of all, take all the things you know about average
muds and throw them out the window. Imagine you're sitting at
home on your desk chair playing your favorite console RPG.
Whether that's Dragon Warrior for the Nintendo, or Final Fantasy
for NES/SNES, this is exactly the experience I was looking to
accomplish. MF is built around an ASCII map (YES, **NO** room
descriptions to read) as well as random encounters, random drops
(Weapons/Armor/Items/Quest Cards/Lottery Tickets/Gold Bars/Random
Cards/Legendary Weapons/Runestones) and an actual STORY. You'll
WANT to play just because you'll want to know how the story ends.
You also don't learn skills/abilities/spells/limit breaks by
going up levels like your ordinary MUDs either, you'll start with
30-40, and then you'll find and buy the others. This game also
has 300 MORTAL levels, which means there is ALWAYS room for
advancement, I'm telling you, once you start playing, it's like
an addiction, it's like that very first Final Fantasy game you
ever played... you just won't want to get up from your chair.
Those of you looking for an easy mud to play need not apply.
Not because this mud isn't newbie friendly, but it's not easy
to master. If you love helping people and creating a trade
like community where everyone benefits from each other, then
again, you should give this place a try.

Description :

 Allegiances Unbroken revolves around a kingdom vs. kingdom
driver.  There are two human kingdoms that are constantly
at odds with each other over various things, religon and
land being the main reasons for clashing.

For those who do not wish to participate in a kingdom vs.
kingdom storyline, we have four other established guilds
available with the option to create mortally ran clans.
Spells, skills and special equipment are/will be available
to the established guilds.

We offer six different races, human, fey, dwarf, drow, orc
and ogre.  There are currently eight different classes,
each having at least one unique 'specialist group'.  These
groups take you away from your run of the mill mage or
cleric (etc.), and are intended to make each character
unique upon creation.

We are based on the familiar map of ROM, but have (and in
the midst of building) several original areas.

Roleplaying is enforced and pk is allowed within a roleplay
reason.

Description :

This mud is not a big cliche like all the other dbgt/dbz/db muds out
there, but its getting tehre so dont worry. Im not going to make a
world just like that of Dragonball GT. Im not gonna stop at the moves
that they have in DBGT either, its just to limiting so expefct alot
more out of this mud then your gunna get out of others. So far I only
have up to Oozaru's or rather if your not a regular japanese speaker
the giant monkeys that Saiyans turn into when tehres a full moon, I
have custom transformation messages, and We are working on getting in
custom fighting moves for added fun. The fighting system is one where
you actually have to pay attention while fighting, cause the muds not
gonna do your fighting for you. We have alot of stuff finished and
the code is clean. Try to enjoy yourselves here.

Sometimes the server is down so dont think the mud is dead and gone
just because you cant connect. This normaly happens later at night,
or perhaps not at all most times.

 A planet colonized thousands of years ago.  A place where
those who wanted peace could live the perfect lives.  But
what happens when the outside galaxy finds out about
this?  Who would pass up the chance to live like royalty,
the chance to start anew.  What choice would you make?
When faced with starvation and death on your arrival,
how low will you sink to survive?

 Yet the inhabitants of the planet had their own history,
their own language, their own culture.  What could they
do to stop the flow of people?  A planetary shield was
developped.  It dissipated metal.  All organic material,
fortunately, would then be caught in the tractor beam,
and brought down to the planet.  Who knew, perhaps they
would build a ship and send off these creatures that
resembled them physically, but whose worth was less than
dirt.

 Would you leave your new life simply because someone who
is unimaginably rich wants you to?  When they see you as
a cheaper source of work, will you work for close to
nothing, under horrible conditions?  Will you band
together?  What will the future bring?  Who will tell
your story when you are gone?

latter is of course provided as well, but beware, combat is deadly

game mechanics takes care of that. It's part of the game, nothing
that is required.

Running since spring 1992 we're one of the older muds still up.

  Welcome my Progeny, do you taste the scent of your prey on the nights^Ò
breeze?  This is because you are a reborn a Vampire, lord of the night, and
all that stands before you is your domain.
 
Our mud is based off of White Wolf's World of Darkness with a unique
perspective on the clan rivalry that makes up the Jyhad.  As a newly
embraced Childe you too will enter the Vampire wars, where every minute is
an opportunity to gain power undreamt of, and to be destroyed.
 
Vampire Wars: The catalyst brings a fresh new update to Jokers Classic
Vampire Wars mud.  With an expanded discipline and skill system, the ability
to diablerize your opponents, new uses for blood and measures of potency,
bloodbonds, and new areas with new equipment, Catalyst represents a new
order of the ages in White Wolf based muds.
 
New vampiric discipline powers include: Flick, Earthshock, Imprint, Zephyr,
Beckoning, Improved hunt, Draw the beast, Taste of death, Disease, and
Silence of Death.  More disciplines are being added constantly.
 
There is no question that with a codebase twice the size of other vampire
wars clones, Catalyst is an Archon with a fresh warrant out to destroy it's
elders while they slumber in torpor.

WWW         : http://www.jail-bait.net/dbe
Description :

 The evolution of the DragonBall theme has happened once 
again. We redid the MUD and gave it a totally new look. For
starters the fighting system was changed to be more 
advanced and it requires more effort to battle. New original
transformations were added in for each race. Player killing
is now a major factor while leveling up. There is a help
file for almost anything you can think of in this MUD. Our
character creation is totally new and stays true to the
DragonBall theme. Traveling to planets was updated to make 
easier and more interesting. A new original planet was added
in for kaios. Just like before each race has their own 
recall and start point on a different planet. We also made 
sure each race has their own special selection of skills to
learn. To make sure each race has an equal chance at 
leveling, we made a newbie zone for each planet. To keep the
newbies safe we made a NonPK command that is enabled for
everyone under level 50 and for when you get PKed. All of
our stats for each character works perfect now. We also 
added planet Arlia, more mini quests, realistic scouters, 
scouter net(walky talky), larger selection of racial 
equipment, new website with forums, room compass, and more
zones. We added a new afterlife that is over 500 rooms with
multiple quests and everything that could be found there in 
the show. The code was changed a bit to give it a new look.
Basically the whole layout of the MUD was changed
for the better. So if you want to see the evolution of this
MUD come and play.

Think Mutant Academy  for the comic verse,
 but with a little bit of X Men Evolutions the
 Cartoon mixed within.  This Muck is a
 haven for Role Players who don't want to 
play an X-Man, or live in an X-Men saturated
 world.  Pretty much its class as usual, just
 for the faces behind the scenes.  This Muck 
is going to take place in the day to day lives
 of those who are unsung, the younger
 mutants who don't go out to become an
 X-Man and save the world.

This takes place during the time line 
of Mutant Academy X, where 
the X-Men are off on their own 
adventures and a pair of Head Master's
have taken run of the school.   The kids 
will be separated into teams under a
professor and of course, be taken into 
Danger Room settings, learn control 
and team work.   Everything is set up in 
Weschester, New York - where Xavier's
mansion resides. From there, the rest of 
the world belongs to New York to wander 
about.  Players are not limited to just Xavier 
students.  Feel free to app normal human 
characters, bad guys, Morlocks, and even 
minor FC's, such as Kitty, Jubilee, or what not.  
Feel free to use your imagination! If you always 
wanted to play that weird mutant with purple 
fur and two heads with a split personality, by 
all means, app it!  2005 is the start of a new 
Year for the young junior mutants of the 
school, so lets get the party started! 
Have fun and RP your hearts out!

  The Sea of Storms is a Wheel of Time MUD based on heavily 
modified SMAUG and primarily focused on role play.  The code is 
designed to emulate the world created by Robert Jordan in exquisite

We also provide a superb enviornment for those who do not wish to RP 
all the time.  We are one of the few true 'RP Encouraged' MUDs, with 
many built-in incentives for Role Playing, though we do not force 
players to be constantly RPing.

We are also one of the only leveless WoT MUDs out there.  
Advancement is based upon use and observation of skills, weaves, 
flows, and weapon forms.  You'll find no need to kill and kill and 
kill to gain levels here.

Features include an unique channeling system, taint for male 
channelers, addiction for both male and female channelers, strength 
and skill differentiation between male and female channelers, a form 
system for four different weapons with 200+ forms, 90+ weaves and 
50+ skills.  We also have multi-guilding, color customization, and 
weapon and armor forging. Other features are a dreamworld, wolfkin, 
angreal, and ter'angreal.

Description :

  The theme of this game is based off the RPG by Palladium 
Books known as RIFTs.  Set in a post apocalyptic version of 
earth in which much of the worlds humanity has been lost.  
A long time has passed since the coming of the rifts and 
while much of the past is gone there have been groups 
forming around what is left of the worlds of all sorts of 
beings.  Some human, some not.

The game is not set in any specific city, though many play 
in Kingsdale which is set in north america.  As time moves 
on, and players come in, we hope to allow other cities to 
be opened.  As of current we have cities for Kingsdale, 
Stormspire, Whykin, Chi-Town, New Horizon (Custom City), 
and even plans for Wormwood and Phaseworld to be built.

-----------------------------------------------------------

While this game advertises adult level violence and sex, it 
doesnt mean that its the only thing that happens here.  It 
could happen, and is not frowned upon unless in public 
rooms (the sex part that is).

  The mud started out being a kinda bashing sport for the
Implementors, It then turned out to be something more.  
All new areas will be coming in soon and most of the old
zones will be removed, if not all.  Most of the zones 
that stay will be modified or implemented into the 
questing side of the mud.  The MUD when finished will 
be approx 1 million + rooms and have a pkilling 
system spanning 40statuses.  If you like the RP game 
Vampire the Masquerade you will find your niche here.  
Clans are reccommended, but not required.  There are 
not as many experience points as there are in most 
God Wars Muds, this is due to the reduced cost to 
train each of the stats.  Most training details have 
been improved, as well as the questing ability of 
the MUD.

are being trade from worlds all around the galaxies. One of
these technologies would be the newest spacefraft, which
can be bought for outrageous prices in star ports. With
trading among alien species becoming an everyday event,
many needs have rippled through the races. The need for
bountyhunters, smugglers, soldiers and even political
masterminds are cried out for. Though some more subtly then
others.

WWW         : http://www.galtrader.com
Description :

  Galactic Trader is a multiplayer space
trading game loosely based on the PC
game 'Elite'. It's reminiscent of old
BBS door games, but is coded for OpenVMS
based Alpha and VAX systems. In the 
original, players would make money buying
and selling goods (some illegal) and evading
cops and hostile aliens in the hopes of 
racking up enough credits to buy
a better vessel or weapons. Successful 
players achieve fame on the high score list. 
In Gamingmuseum.com's enhanced version, 
players can now join the Imperial
Navy or Galactic Police, or even become a 
member of the hostile Thargoid race. There
are many new ships and new equipment, such
as tractor beams and fusion torpedoes.
Players can build their own bases and outposts.
Capital ships can carry fighter squadrons, and
mount multiple laser cannons.

Support is available in the Galtrader group 
on Yahoo! Groups.

Description :

Asgardian Nightmare has a long and successful history.  
Peaking at a playerbase of as many as 30 players on at a time,
we have recently dropped to more like six or seven players on 
at a time.  This was due to a long period of downtime, but we
are currently looking for more players.  We offer a great pk
environment as well as an equally great nonpk environment.  
We are looking to rebuild our playerbase, so newbies are
always welcome.  One of the most outstanding parts of our mud
is random item generation.  It works like the items in Diablo
2, where an item is assigned prefixes and suffixes that give
it extra stat bonuses or drawbacks.  With a huge number of
prefixes and suffixes, as well as condition tags, there are
literally millions of possibilites for random items.  
Builders are constantly working on new areas, so the mud is
constantly evolving.  We offer three tiers of classes, with
21 third tier classes to choose from, and the option to let
your race evolve into one of many new races as you gain
experience.  Please give our mud a try, you may just like it.

Description :

[This game requires a client program, easily acquired from

 Spellbound is a free online multiplayer roguelike game. To win the game,
you must build up a character and live and grow in the Forgotten Realms's
City of Splendors, Waterdeep. You must be powerful enough to defeat Bane the
Black Lord's last avatar, as he has fortified himself 5000 feet under the
city, in the infamous Underdark, and is mustering an army of power unseen
before. As you work towards this near-impossible goal, you will chart
unexplored reaches of the Underdark, do battle with legendary creatures, and
find lost artifacts. And of course throughout your journeys you will
encounter many other adventurers -- whether they be friend or foe is up to
you to decide!

 ..based on Angband by Ben Harrison and MAngband by Keldon Jones. If you
loved Nethack, Angband, Rogue, Omega or other ASCII-based games of the past,
you will love this one.

 Godwars: Saints from Shadows is a slower pace godwars 
mud.  Players do not max thier characters in a few hours, 
it takes time.  We have 7 uniquely coded classes. Some of
them look and sound familier to older godwars classes but 
they have been redone and redesigned.  Darkelf is a 
redesigned Drow class.  But now it follows more closly to
the D&D Drows.  We have an original dragon and Hell Hound 
classes. We do have the Highlander and Mage classes, but
they have been redone with new powers.  Monk and ninja
have also been recoded.  We also offer the stock LoW4
Werewolf code.  It will be recoded into a Shaman class 
later.  Recently a remort system has been added that 
allows players who work hard to become multi-classed.
We have a unique forge code here that allows players to 
find ores to forged into new equipment instead of just
finding slabs to slap onto existing equipment.  The fight 
code on the mud has also been recoded to let the balancing 
of classes be easier to do.  The classes are not completly 
balanced but they are close.  The immortals are almost 
always on to help newbies with questions.  And we always
welcome ideas to help improve the mud.

Hope you stop by.

As it is confronted by soldiers of might.

In a time of crystal and the youthful old
The message of love arrives by moonlight.

To journey to Ginzuishou MUX without a fear
For all secrets shall become bare
As those noble souls carry the light near.

Description :

  NYCX is an X-men mush where you'll see many familiar characters
from the comics, cartoons and movies, but with a twist. This is a 
'what if?' that focuses on reality and the darkness of the human 
nature. How the environment is shaped depends on you, the players,
and your characters. The world you know ICly will be shaped completely
by your actions.  Any fate is possible and we want to see all the
corners explored.It is only recently that there was a sudden explosion
of numbers of homo superior. With this sudden increase in numbers
mankind has become aware that they are not alone. A new race has
emerged among them. Some people fear mutants, some people are
indifferent and others are fascinated by them. Public opinion is divided
from human extremists who still believe in lynch mobs to the groupies
who are obssessed with mutants and their powers.Essentially, while 
we have taken themes and characters from Marvel comic books and
a familiarsetting in the shape of New York City, this is where the similarity 
ends. Currently we now have a Brotherhood of Mutants and Xavier is
slowly brining new mutants to his side. The other established organization
is the Division 6, a police force that focuses on criminal investigations
that deals with mutants. On the force are both humans and mutants, 
some corrupt and some with a good heart, although all unknowingly
aiding a government project that deals with mutant experimentation
called  Weapon Plus. New York city has become the focus for some
of the most obvious mutant activity with changes happening everyday.
It's a strange new world where anything could happen.

 For for those interested in PVP, we have assassins
for those who want to live it 24/7, and the Arena
for those who'd rather just try it out once in a
while.
 
 We like RP, but it's not a requirement. We do reward
good RP if we see it, and the world is written
'seriously' so that if you want to RP, you will be
able to feel 'right' in the world of Aurealis.
 
 Our staff is dedicated to giving the players a fun
place to play, with  as little interference as
possible. AR welcomes players from all over the
world to come and join in a fun, expansive MUD that
can easily become your new home online.
 
We look forward to meeting you!

thing, but also set up to start off on their own original and unique
adventure. 


Even if you don't know much (or anything) about the Star Ocean 
universe, that's not really an obstacle that will prevent you from
creating and enjoying a character in the rich envrionment we offer
for your pleasure!   (we already have at least one player that's
never touched any of the games :))

WWW         : http://www.inzannadeecreations.com/eternity/
Description :

 Three thousand years ago, our world, our way of life, and our very existence
was threatened. War broke out with an unbeatable foe. A foe created by the
enemy of the true children of our good Father. Flight was our only option.
And here we have made our new home. There is hope here, children. The Order
of Eternity holds the balance of justice and maintains the order of the
Races on what could have been a hostile new world filled with chaos. We have
remembered the knowledge lost to us in the Landing. The High Consul promises
us many great things. We prosper and thrive.

Yet, do not smile so soon, children. The slaves, who have been part of our
traditions from the beginning of our creation, threaten to subdue our way of
life. The Second Betrayers are trying to rise up and crush the hearts and
spirits of the true children of our good Father. They are heretics and
anarchists! And all because of the foolish words of a mad heretical elf,
they believe it is their time to bring the omens to fruition. So, tell me,
children, whose side will you stand on when you take your place in the
world? The side of goodness and order, or with those Betrayers of Alordast?

Omens promises to be a rich, original world where the Races (elves, dwarves,
humans, and nubis) try to live together, magic is real, and technology is
advanced. God-given Power, secret rebellion, noble riches, or modest
obscurity could be yours.

*Still heavily under construction, we are in great need of coders above all
and invite those with experience and a passion for roleplaying to join
our team. Browse the webpage, and whether a coder or builder, your interest
is appreciated.

Description :

  (The following is a review by one of the players, which does a
better job of describing us than any of our own words can}

  'Legend of the Nobles, or LotN, is the mud I call home. With 
dedicated administration and an incredible coder, LotN runs quite 
smoothly...

  As well as original races, there are many interesting classes to 
choose from. Be the mighty fighter, or the sly rogue. Be the Paladin, 
and fight for your religion. Be a Conjurer, and dabble in demon 
summoning and work with the undead. Be a bard, and play your melodies 
to influence and inspire others. Be a shape-shifting druid, attuned 
to nature. Be a mage with the power to enchant armor and weapons. Or 
be a priest, where you don't fight and you gain experience through 
healing others and drawing powerful glyphs.

  This mud has a pleasant balance between roleplaying and player   
killing ... With the guild, religion, and noble systems, there is 
plenty of opportunity for intrigue.

  One of the most notable changes this version is the inclusion of 
permdeath ... will ensure a more realistic atmosphere. Those who do 
not play permdeath cannot achieve the highest ranks.

 I recommend anyone who reads to this to join us. All of our long-
time players are always willing to help a new face in any way we can. 
And right now, with the new version, everyone will start off on even 
footing, level-wise. So please, come join us.'

unique professions such as doctors(with medications, anesthesia 
and field surgery), herbalists and a spell system boasting over 
150 spellsin specialties such as divination, conjuration, and

vehicles (planes, trains,and cars), and exploration XP make the

Touches like optional player descriptions, the Out of Character

it a great roleplaying environment--and of course there are the 
dozens and dozens of quests ranging from the minor to the epic. 
There are no rent fees, but there are themed free-forming clans, 
a complex weapons proficiencies system for variable speed combat,
Immortal-run games within the game such as recall tag and trivia 
and flag hunts, and of course furniture to sit on, in, or around. 
All this plus stable code, the Legendary Times newsletter, the 
Legend Discussion Forum, and a mature, friendly playerbase. All 
of our areas are original and carefully researched, from Ancient 
Egypt and Celtic Ireland to Viking Scandinavia and the Crusades
to Victorian London and Gold Rush San Francisco.

Description :

  An original themed MUCK, Nomen encompasses a very in-depth
story. Set in a high fantasy realm, it focuses on a long war
that has been fought between two majour countries - Nerravyn
and Serensith, divided by races and cultures, and even
climates. Wild Magic divides the lands, making travel almost
impossible unless the river Anynduil is utilized - and that
has a thriving black-market trade on it. Political intrigue,
high adventure, mystery, drama, horror...everything is
available here. 

We have a great RP Staff to take care of TPs and oversee
fairness issues. A caring wizard staff will take care of your
needs, and is more than willing to listen to any suggestions
or concerns a player may have. And seeing as Nomen is new, we
are looking for more staffers to fill up the RP Staff and the
Help Staff.

Although the theme is very important, the roleplay is
completely consentual and freeform. Extensive lore is
available about the lands, along with the common races there -
and although it is important, they are not rules that you must
strictly follow.

Description :

  Dark Towers started in October of 1996. It's gone through quite a number
of ups and downs on the great road of life. We at Dark Towers feel that
the whole point of a mud is for your enjoyment. We sincerely believe that
players are the most important aspect of the mud. They provide much needed
feedback and liveliness to the mud that without them wouldn't be there.
We at Dark Towers are also extremely open to any suggestions you might
have to help make it a better place.
 
The theme of Dark Towers is based mostly on fantasy, but we try to make a
little bit of what everyone wants. If there is something that you feel is
missing, let us know and we'll do our best to add it.

Attrition has cut down on some of our immortal ranks, so we are in need of
builders right now. We can help with training. All that is needed is a creative 
mind!

Players are also very much needed, so we will have 
somebody to build for!

WWW         : http://lensmoor.org/
Description :

    Lensmoor is a cross between a roleplaying mud, 
and a hack&slash mud. Players are encouraged to roleplay, 
and are often drawn into roleplaying situations, and 
efforts are made to reward good roleplaying, without the 
overbearing nature of many strict roleplaying muds. 

    Players are able to become part of the world, operating 
their own stores, crafting their own goods, and governing 
towns and clans. At the same time, traditional mud
diversions such as questing and leveling are supported for 
the times when other players involved in your plots aren't 
online. The mud averages over 50 players online at a time, 
with over 100 at peak times, so there are always people to 
interact with.

    Technically, Lensmoor is a superior game. It is 
typically up for months between crashes, worthy player 
suggestions are implemented within days of suggestion, new 
areas are constantly created, and our website is one of the 
most integrated mud website around, allowing full access to 
whois (finger), notes, maps, helps, and more.

bristling warriors make their livings alongside sinister aliens who perform 
experiments upon abductees in sterile orbiting laboratories.  Here is a 
world so distinguished from all others, that you will hearken to its wild 
strangeness with childish fireside interest and awe.  

Leviathan features: multi-classing, enhanced limb combat, 9 schools of 
magic, detailed life skill system, the battle arena, guild wars, player 
owned shops, player-owned real estate, player-stalking bounty hunter,

WWW         : None
Description :

  Founded in September, 2003, by two longtime roleplayers from
a similar game, Aftermath is based around the theory that
canon can and at times should be thrown out the window.
Here, the worlds detailed in Star Trek and Star Wars, which
are all too often compared rather than examined, are placed
side by side and allowed to interact. Additionally, a system
has been set up by which factions and characters from
entirely different universes- even original ones- can be
added to the system. By allowing these worlds to coexist, we
create a brand new environment for roleplayers of any skill
level to enjoy.

Aftermath staff would like to point out that non-original
aspects of the game are still the property of their original
creators, no matter how skewed their surroundings might be.

Description :

   Lochness is one of the older muds, but what it lacks in modernization, 
it makes up for in atmosphere!  Both players and wizards are generally
friendly and helpful, especially to newbies.  Geographically, the mud is
divided into a multitude of domains, each with a different theme and a
different team of wizards working on areas.  There are six distinctive 
guilds to choose from, and plenty of quests to challenge players.  It is 
not, and has never been, Lochness' policy to instawiz players, but once a
player reaches a certain level, he is presented with the option of either 
wizzing, or playing the higher levels.  Obscenity on public communication
channels is frowned upon, although players may say what they like to each
other in private :)  As for the number of people who play Lochness, it is 
certainly a small mud in that regard, but we look at it as having a 'small
town' ambience in which everybody knows everybody else.

Description :

  Welcome to Metropolis Universalis, a modern day mega-city
where anything can and does happen. Where the man on the street
can be much more than a man and the woman next door could be a
bearer of dark magicks.

  Created as a place to be minimally administrated and maximally
used for RP fun and mayhem, anything goes on the streets of
Metropolis, a city located on the island of Okinawa.

  Enter if you dare but be sure to leave your sanity at home and
pack an extra dose of wit and grit. The streets are even more
dangerous than your parents warned you about and more fun than
they feared you'd ever have.

Telnet      : www.annwn.org 4242 [80.60.108.166]
WWW         : http://www.annwn.org/
Description :

 Annwn is a Celtic Mythology themed MUD, loosely based on the
stories of the Mabinogi, Arthurian legend, and historical facts from
pre- and post-Roman Britain.
 
Annwn is set in a world and time roughly equivalent to Celtic
Britain of 400AD, but with elements of pre 50AD.
 
The world of Annwn has four known realms: Fair Arberth is a
civilized High Kingdom made up of the four independent kingdoms
of Dyfed, Rhos, Melewyn and Bruga.
 
The Highlands are a wild land of mountains and forests where
giants still rule the land. Savage Jorthu is a realm of barbarian
invaders. Hibernia is a peaceful, cultured land of learning. There
are rumours of a fifth realm - the mythical realm of Annwn itself,
home of the Tuatha Lords.
 
Annwn has six races available for player selection:
Human, Formorian, Tuatha, Grishnak, Corrak and Giant.
 
The basic Guilds of Annwn are the Artisans, the Bards, the
Dewiniaid, the Druids, the Rogues and the Warriors. Each guild has
it's own unique way of offering sub-guilds to the players. Multi-guilding
will be allowed at a later stage.
 
Annwn is run by a small but very dedicated team of very friendly and
creative people. Our world is 100% original and the mudlib is
customised to suit.

We are currently open in a Beta test phase for players, so a lot of
features may not be working correctly. We are always on the look out for
people that would like to code in a Celtic themed MUD (LPC experience
not necessary).

continue on down the High Road. Long have you travelled to reach the
fabled city of legend. Now with its pristine alabaster walls so near, your
spirit stirs with the excitement and anticipation which forced your first
steps. You stop, realizing that the sounds of peace are silenced. No more
do you hear the sparrows song, nor the rabbits steps. All is silent. A
thunderous voice assails you from ahead, 'Dare not seek refuge within 
those accursed walls! Think you of yourself so highly? Only those who
wish to seek the throne of the heavens themselves dare. So let me help 
you friend...' Emerging from the trees ahead, a mighty Frost Giant bearing
a wicked axe smiles devilishly at you. 'Come mortal...seek death, for I
have found ye...' Do you dare challenge the gods?

Description :

   Our mud has been in place a while now, but we're still
going strong. After a server change, we have brought our 
storyline around full-circle, so it's never too late to join in
and start roleplaying. Most everything revolves around your
skills as a storyteller, from levels, to stats, special moves,
and more! Not a good roleplayer? Don't worry, we lend advice 
and pointers, so everyone can succeed. We're Dragonball-themed, 
but not as juvenile as most, and we hold a generally 
adult-oriented stamp because we do have violence, as well as 
adult content. But our roleplay is addictive, with an easy to 
learn system that ensures any fight is uncertain, and no one is 
guaranteed to win. PK is out of bounds for the moment, but 
there are rules involving it, and it is involved in quests. 
Don't take my word for it; swing by and experience the place 
for yourself.

     Magrathea is a realm that spans eons of time, that encompasses
the mystical abilities of magic, and of the mind, that incorporates
the most far flung technologies of the future. In this world, it
is possible to travel from the distant past, a time of wizardry
and of mighty beasts, to the future, where the most awesome of
war-machines have been created. This is a realm of great adventure,
a place of opportunity where with a bit of luck, and a good measure
of skill it is possible to forge a massive empire which spans the
whole of Magrathea's existence.

   Magrathea is loosely based on the Hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy
series. It offers a wide range of clans and areas. Magrathea has areas
ranging from those based on Babylon 5 and Dr. Who to a modern 
shopping mall and science museum to classic stock areas with Tolkien
and medieval themes. There are many unique races including Drow,
Sprite, Numenor, Vogon, and Klingon, as well as ten races of dragon.

   Role Play is strongly encouraged and rewarded and PK is available,
but restricted by clan and level. Although there are many additions
and changes to Rom 2.4b, it is easy to play especially for those 
familiar with ROM, but offers many new features.

you, please read on! If we're not, you'll find a lot has changed, for the better! Come check
out our new grid, rewritten, recoded, redone!

 Masquerade takes place in the city of Albuquerque, New Mexico. Surrounded by the towering
Sandia mountain range to the east, the Manzano mountains to the southeast, and a high
volcanic mesa to the west, Albuquerque sits astride the nurturing Rio Grande River. Dizzying
views unfold over sweeping vistas across a truly magical landscape, filled with a myriad
natural wonders. If New Mexico is truly the 'Land of Enchantment,' then Albuquerque must be
its gateway.

 Although many things seem to be the same on the surface, our virtual Albuquerque is a far
cry from the reality of this happy Southwestern town. The town has been transformed from its
real world countenance into a mass of decay, danger and death. This is a world where evil
and danger abound, where tension is stronger, cops more corrupt, the criminal element even
more firmly in control. And that's even before the Supernaturals start pulling strings... If
you're not afraid of the Dark, come check us out!

Mud         : Atlantis MUSH
Code Base   : [MUSH] PennMUSH version 1.7.4 patchlevel 20
Telnet      : atlantis.hawkgames.com 4201 [4.14.71.136]
WWW         : http://www.hawkgames.com/atlantis/
Description :

  Atlantis MUSH is based around an ongoing war between the 
Capitalist Alliance and the Totalitarian Regime. The year
is 2114 and the surface world has been destroyed and is
uninhabitable. The two factions live together in Atlantis.
Atlantis was a deep sea research facility created by the
Neutral Alliance and protected by the Mercenary Guild. An
uneasy peace resides in Atlantis, but the waters around are
full of open conflict.

  Atlantis uses an adaptation of Simple Role-Playing Game. This
allows for character specialization without the complexity of
having to choose 1.4 million skills. Atlantis is so easy to play,
girls who have never played a MUSH before play there. In addition
to submarines, hovertanks, and such, players can also wield
magic. Primarily, magic is used to heal, throw opponents away
from combat, and turn invisible to sneak around.

Medievia V is now open!

There are many new features and updates. The main ones are ClanShips
(see http://www.medievia.com/ships.html), MobFactions,
DungeonMaster, and live maps (complete with our own custom font that
uses shapes, not letters; see
http://www.medievia.com/fonts/font.html).

We have it all! Dragon flight. Clans that actually create their own
towns. Wilderness. Bloodlines. MobFactions that make the game more
like a real-time strategy game. The DungeonMaster took 3 years to
program and tracks parties' happiness, pride, sadness, and fear,
making good or bad MobFactions around them--basically DMing the
world.

We always have hundreds of people playing, 24/7. We started in 1992
and never stopped adding and tweaking. Now, in 2005, Medievia V is
here!

In Medievia you will find raging wilderness fires, giant monsters
the size of cities, deep storm systems, awesome weather, all kinds
of PK, over five hundred zones, many god-run quests, AutoQuests,
dragonlairs, dragonhunters, serpenthunters, Master Heroes, multi-
level requirements, trading with covered wagons, wagon trains,
mules, and ships, and politics, with a new governor elected every
month to help run the game. We have all the normal things like 
flying, mounts, formations, hero battles, custom prompts, and more.

We are about to open clan businesses, where clans hire workers to
work real active zones, like mines and farms, in our wilderness. We
will soon open Abodes where the deepest bloodlines get everything
from huts to large castles, complete with MobFactions and roads.

The Medievia wilderness and ocean are alive and dripping with
adventure!

Telnet      : linkwarriors.wilkerstaff.com 4000 [208.233.223.2]
WWW         : None
Description :

  END-OF-LINE is based on the film TRON. But it begins where the film
ends. The Blue programs have just managed to break the MCP's strangle hold,
but there are still pockets of Red programs resisting. The MUD is
based on the war between these two sides. You can choose which side to
join, and what role to play in each army.-----There are two main roles: 
generals and troops. The generals manage troops and resources, transport 
them between areas, and decide which areas should be attacked. The 
troops fight individual battles. There are NPC generals and troops on both 
sides, as well as interactive generals and troops.  These players can join 
and leave at their leisure.-----The distinguishing thing about the MUD is
that it involves 3 levels of play, which interact: (LEVEL 1) is involves playing a
general managing resources in a war. This is very strategic and is like Chess
but more closesly like X-battle. (LEVEL 2) involves commanding troops in a
battle. This is like a game of Command and Conquer, you can see a map
with the troops and position them. (LEVEL 3) involves close range fighting.
This is the level which players familiar to Player Killing will recognise.
It is likeplaying a shoot-em up like DOOM.

Description :

  Realms of Exploration is set in the Forgotten Realms world
just after the book trilogy - Return of the Archwizards. 

We are in the Beta pahse of the MUD. Fine tuning everything as well 
as adding in more zones. Though we are primarily a RolePlay MUD we 
offer zones to level in as well. Bsically we hope that if you come 
for the levels you stay for the RolePlay.

The race and class selection is based on AD&D basics with some
very minor variations. Drow and Minotaur are allowed races while the 
core Classes are completely available. I am always open to 
suggestions. I am also working on a useable/workable 'Prestige 
Class' system. The webpage is updated as often as I can.

The world of Realms of Exploration starts in Shadowdale. The world 
is open for Exploration. With just over 1000 rooms we are still 
small but at the same time we have a small but dedicated group of 
builders expanding it daily.

There have been many pieces of code added to the MUD and continue to 
be added and tweaked. One of the current projects is a Hometown 
Starting point. Though we have to add new towns to add hometowns. 

Stop in enjoy the mud talk with the Imms who are on and other 
players who show up at different times. Keep your eyes open for 
people and places that might be part of the roleplay.

WWW         : http://www.plumed-serpent.com/tfdd.html
Description :

  Decepticon Dominion plays out a sweeping tale of Transformer history,
starting from familiar ground on mid-1980's Earth and continuing beyond all
usual limits, with much room along the way for innovation and exploration.
This universe is firmly grounded in the pre-Movie cartoons, and
characterizations are true to those given on the show.  Excellent characters
from other eras and universes are also present, to give the best possible
mix of the greatest of the Decepticons. Can a single-faction MUSH capture
the drama and conflict inherent to Transformers? Definitely. Decepticon
interactions among themselves are every bit as fascinating, perhaps more so,
than the usual Decepticon/Autobot conflict - because there's forever a fine
balance between the sense of team loyalty and the continued drive to better
oneself. A one faction Mush eliminates the need to maintain an artificially
static environment between two sides, where neither can truly advance, let
alone triumph. Here, this question will be explored - what *would* the
Decepticons do after vanquishing their long-time enemies? The universe
itself lies open.

We're a role-playing based MUSH with some combat RP. We focus on character
interaction and living not only the life of a character but an entire team.
We have regular planned events every Saturday at 5pm EST and RP during the
week is encouraged. We have a lot of great Decepticon characters open for
applications and we accept orignal apps as well. News files and character
profiles can be found at http://www.plumed-serpent.com/tfdd.html

Description :

   Miami by Night, up since January of 1997, is a World of Darkness(tm)
MUSH set in Miami, Florida, in the first decade of the 21st Century. We
support the following second edition systems: Vampire: The Masquerade(tm),
Mage: The Ascension(tm), and Werewolf: The Apocalypse(tm). 

   Our Staff prides itself on its fairness, and players can be assured
that the rules are enforced equally. Each player is just as important as
every other player and staff will not step in to retcon or rewrite scenes to
benefit any particular player's 'story' over another's. If you like a game
where scenes are not prescripted and you will not be prevented from action
as long as you have IC justification, then Miami may be the place for you.

   There are no quotas for Supers (vampires, shifters, mages, etc.) on
Miami by Night in order to give players the chance to play the type of
character they want, although each player is restricted to one Super. Mortal
character creation uses Mortal Peer stats, meaning a starting stats mortal
has the same starting attributes and abilities as a neonate vampire.
Transfer characters from other MUSHes in the same general timeline are
accepted, provided we can verify stats. More information on character
creation and transfer can be found on our web site or by logging into
Miami by Night.

seven clans on Chaos Empire. They each have their own clanhouse,
equipped with a store room and a board. Each clan also has its own
special abilities, which are generally very powerful (some are spells,
and some are character bonuses).

  Newbie Helpers are there to help new players, new mudders and experienced 
players alike which are just starting out, if no Newbie Helper is on an 
Immortal will be happy to help you get started.

  The main city is custom to Chaos Empire, and should provide a refreshing 
change to other MUDs. We aren't a large MUD, so there won't be
hundreds of people on at any time, but the people on are, in general,
friendly and will help you if you ask nicely :-)

Description :

 Deep in the timeless expanse of the Astral Plane, the corpse
of a forgotten god floats. A city is carved in the face of
the god, ruled by the Ancient, the first to dare to live 
there. Said to be human, he is a sorcerer so old his name has 
been forgotten. Nursing his power after a recent defeat in a 
distant plane, he gathers to him an army of the Sworn.

The stone skin of the god is riddled with tunnels and small
dwellings. Secretive cults plot the revival and the 
destruction of the dead god. Others struggle merely to 
survive. The underside is a place of graves, monsters, and 
the undead. The interior has rotted away into the seeds
of a new material plane, where nature takes its course.

Ark of Fools MUX is a tabletop-style game, with players
meeting at regular times. We use the D&D 3E game system 
(playing it by the book except for the setting).
The current campaign runs weeknights from 8-11 pm EST, so if
you are interested and can make those times, please come and 
take a look. :-)

America was in the Justice Society, and the Hulk irradiated 
by the Captain Atom project. An Elseworld world where
Metahumans granted great power by chance live alongside 
mutants born with an X-Factor. This is th world of DC 
Legends.

The continuity is based loosely on a creative mix of the 
entire line of DC comics, RPG and supplements, with a tone 
perfected by the various Animated Series. It takes what 
everyone loves best about DC - The characters - and moves 
them to a new place and new situations, giving new and 
exciting challenges to the players. Want your own original 
character? No problem. Our system allows a fast and easy way 
to make your own to match the heroes many of us have grown 
up reading about. We even allow adaptations from other 
themes to happen... within reason.

There are two main holdings of heroes and villains, the 
territory which one side strives to protect, the other, to 
control... Metropolis and Gotham. As the game grows though, 
Micro Cities may pop up.

Join us today... take your unique perspective on your 
favourite hero, and make it a character to play at-

Mud         : Mirkwood
Code Base   : [Rom] Heavily Modified
Telnet      : mirkwoodmud.org 4000 [192.139.173.247]
WWW         : http://www.mirkwoodmud.org
Description :

Mirkwood stared in 1995 and is still going strong. Famous for its social
atmosphere, its inspired areas, and its professional coding, Mirkwood
is a dynamic and active MUD undergoing almost daily code modifications.
Recently, the coders implemented an original remorting system and added
six new classes. But the largest recent change was a complete remapping of
the world that involved splitting the land into two continents and creating
an extensive road system. Mirkwood's original and extremely powerful object,
room, and mob scripts aid builders in creating immersive areas, many of which
are based on the writings of Tolkien. However, Mirkwood's player and immortals
are far too eclectic to stick to one theme. The battle-scarred moon Daktor,
the red-neck Trailer Park, the magic-loathing city of Pelios, the vast and
deadly Ocean, and scores of other areas all await the stalwart adventurer.
Mirkwood's custom-designed area builder (Mac/Win) supports the continuous
development of new areas. If you love the community of your fellows, join
one of Mirkwood's eight tribes, which have huge castles and keeps; their
own channels; custom time and weather messages; internal security; shops
for armor, weapons, food, and tokens; recall rooms; healers, trainers, and
guild masters; and access to a tribal arena.

Description :

   Land of the Lost Unicorn places a priority on friendliness and enjoyment
of a mudding atmosphere by combining the benefits of roleplaying and combat.
The immortals of this realm try their best to be responsive to the players
by listening to complaints and ideas. Most ideas or proposed changes get
implemented if they are found beneficial to the entire mud. The players are
cordial and happy, and often communicate extensively on our many channels.

   LUN, as it is called for short, offers 12 races and 12 classes and a
variety of features too numerous to name. If there is a feature you want that
we don't have, please feel free to let us know! We have left the original
customization in, though most prefer to use the base skills and spells each
class has in. We also offer an alternative mud school for players who are
familiar with the rom code, as well as offer the stock mud school for new
mudders to learn from. We are in the process of adding new original areas
to eliminate the stock to give known mudders new lands to explore.

   One thing that we do pride ourselves on is our complete and up-to-date help
files. This makes us a good choice for new mudders and those who are sick of
having to ask about everything. There is also a question/answer channel on the
mud for questions that you can't answer through help files.

   LUN has a religion system of nine separate religions, each is led by a
fellow player, and follows a mythical god and ethos.

style combat. The standard Arena has been expanded and filled
with items that could be of use. We support 3 modes, Team, Clan,
and Single combat. Immortals can use areas of the world for the staging of
war, giving non-playerkillers the experience of a player killer
without actually being a player killer and with out fear of loss
in experience or equipment.

  Randomly generated equipment like those found in Diablo/D II, Nethac
and Angband. A fully functioning clan system that allows for players to create
and maintain/expand their own. A starvation system that makes the need for food
and drink a must. Quest point system includes Trash Points, Mystery Tickets,
and ImmQuest points. Come Play and ENJOY!

Current player-driven events to advance the plot include:

*An excavation of an underground Age of Legends city.
*A search for the missing Daughter-Heir, Elayne.


Bookies are available upon application, some are currently
already in played.

We are currently hiring Coders, every Coder recieves an imortal, and if you refer us a Coder it could possibly result in a reward or Experience points or Quest points.

Description :

  Deep within the black obelisks thrusting upwards into the bitterly cold night
a small fire burns in a rusted out garbage can, casting dim halos of orange
light on the damp asphalt. Hands raised over the meager heat, a multitude of
wretched forms shiver as tattered wet clothes cling to their bodies, leeching
the strength from even the hardiest. Nearby, in a small park a tiny child looks
out into the shadows, her vision blurred by tears, desperately searching for
her mother. A flicker of movement catches her attention and she looks up to see
the bushes at the edge of the clearing part. Her scream echoes through the open
window of a luxurious basement apartment. There is no one to answer her cries
for help. A crumpled body leans heavily against the desk, an expanding pool of
blood staining the immaculate Armani suit and the letter clutched in a hand
white as ash.
 
Note: Applications required for non-Mortal characters.

Description :

We've had several exciting new developments on the Cleft of
Dimensions! First off, we've got a whole new set of classes for
you to play around with. The new roster is Knight, Warrior, Thief,
Wizard, Priest, Geomancer, and Summoner. Each class plays differently,
so there should be a fun class for everybody. And maybe even more
exciting than that - the Cleft of Dimensions supports sound now!
Go to our website and download the GMud sound trigger pack, and
you can listen to the Cleft of Dimensions while you play! Exciting?
Of course it is!

The Cleft of Dimensions has existed as the ever-present space between
worlds. In Final Fantasy 5, Gilgamesh was banished to the cleft by
Exdeath, and in Final Fantasy 8, Odin's sword Ragnarok slipped into
his hands.  Using the Ragnarok, Gilgamesh cut through the fabric of
the Cleft of Dimensions and was able to travel freely through it.
His actions tore the fabric of space-time, causing cosmic disturbances.
Portions of various dimensions fall through and into the cleft in
chaotic fashion.  The worlds of Final Fantasy, Seiken Densetsu, Mario
RPG, Infocom, and many other RPGs combine in the Cleft of Dimensions,
a world populated by creatures from video games and anime.  With a
wide background, there is something for every wannabe adventurer in
the Cleft of Dimensions!

Telnet      : mozartmud.com 4500 [69.220.173.202]
WWW         : http://www.mozartmud.com
Description :

 Mozart is one of the oldest, most developed muds on the net. Our
world has over 28,000 rooms in 200 zones among three major areas.
The Surface is the largest and most newbie-friendly. Beneath, the
svirfneblin city Galtherdelve and the drow city of Aluhryn in the
Underdark are more dangerous, and player-killing is legal.

 Mozart is rent-free. While in other muds it may cost you gold to
keep your items, here we make our players want to play instead of
punishing them for being away. Further, we use a percentage-based
loading system instead of object limits, so it's impossible for a
small number of players to hoard all the best equipment.

 All the major features of mud clients, including aliases, speed-
walking, and command history, are provided by the game itself, so
all our players - even those on telnet - are on an equal footing.

 Mortals may advance to level 99 in 14 different classes and more
than 400 different skills, spells, and specializations (which are
similar to D20-system feats). After 99th, there are eleven avatar
levels each with a skill, spell, or power specific to each class.

 Mozart's code is very stable and very highly featured. We rarely
go less than two weeks between reboots. Crashes are rare, and new
code is well-tested before it gets anywhere near our players.

 Immortals have access to full OLC including every feature we can
think of, all the way up to LP-mud style scripting. If you have a
new idea, we'll work to make it possible.

 We welcome all comers, new and old. See you online!

Description :

  A terrible plague killed about 97% of the world’s population
in 2009. Now, almost 20 years later, Boston Massachusetts has
become a major metropolis populated by survivors. The control of
the government and their propaganda are impossible to escape.
Travel to and from the other few populated areas of the United
States is dangerous and deadly.


  The Reformed Republic now mainly consists of three rebuilt
cities; New Boston, New Providence and New Hartford. Within the
game setting, most people crowd in the center city, New Boston,
and enjoy the comforts of technology and the protection of the
military. The less fortunate must scrape a living in the
outskirts, living without electrical power or the benefits of law
enforcement. The contrast is sharp, but nothing is ever in black
and white.

Description :

  Realms of Chaos, also known as RoC, is an extremely
challenging, thoroughly engrossing reality. From the
moment you set foot in the Realms, you will be enchanted
by the vivid, full ansi color descriptions, and the 
highly intricate, refreshingly logical and internally 
consistent structure to an extent which you have 
undoubtedly never before experienced.

Realms of Chaos runs on its own machine and connection,
and is incredibly well-balanced and fair.  Anti-cheating
rules are actually enforced.  You can therefore be proud
of your achievements on RoC, as people do not gain levels
by exploiting bugs or imbalances.

RoC is a challenging mud.  Those looking for a place they
can become powerful overnight will be disappointed. 
However, it is the perfect mud for someone looking to 
earn their levels, and to be able to take pride in making 
it to High Mortal, because it is not something just anyone 
can do.

When you check out RoC for yourself, you will see a well 
developed fantasy world that has room for humor and 
parody.  It is not just a mud; to those who know it, it is 
another dimension.

difference is too high, the higher status player cannot
attack the lower one.

PaNiC uses a prototype flag system so mortals can build
areas online.

Since some networks restrict access to port 4000, PaNiC
also listens for connections on port 8080.

Description :

   Nightmare is a virtual fantasy society.  The goal of the game 
is what you make it. If you like hack-n-slash, then you can
play as a mighty fighter, or if its harmony you seek, a 
cleric is your calling. Nightmare has 8 classes to chose from: 
bard, cleric, fighter, fisher, kataan, mage, monk, and rogue.  
Your advancement on Nightmare is determined not by how many 
monsters you kill, but instead how you perform as a member of 
your chosen class.  The option to multi-class is available for those 
who desire multiple skills.

Of course, you must always watch out for death.  Unlike other muds, 
however, death on Nightmare takes you to the Underworld, the domain 
of the undead.  You may seek out resurrection and return to the realm 
of the living, or instead risk permanent death and play the game as a 
member of the undead. 

Other features include: 19 player races, languages, optional quests, an 
expansive help system, limb-oriented combat. Finally, Nightmare runs 
on a machine bought with player dollars so Nightmare will always have 
a site.

toward a realm that is realistic within the premise of a magical
world.

   We offer a detailed law system that varies from city to city,

new lands, slaying dragons, roleplaying, or questing for adventure
lies in your blood, come join us and drink your fill.

Description :

 Nirvana has now been around for a what seems forever.
Most of the players and wizards have long term investment
in Nirvana and care about it.
 
 Nirvana follows an older style of LPmud with no set theme.
The result of this being wizard creativity runing in all
directions producing a diverse world where just about
anything can happen from couples having babies to adventuring
in bowl of jello occupied by strange critters.
 
 Players can have as many characters as they like so long
as they do not have interaction between them. (only one
can be used at a time) PK is limited to those who wish
it and in certain areas of the game. Along with risk free
sparing options and other features that allow players to
enjoy the thrill of a more lively opponent. That said,
there are also NPC's that are almost alive, to where some
players mistake them for other players.
 
 Nirvana has had the 'honor' of having other muds try to
copy it in whole or part, sometimes using less than
honest means to do so. But there can be no true copy,
don't accept an imitation when only the original will
do.

What is remort, you ask? Once you reach level 100 you can
become level 1 again, with EITHER a class OR a race change,
and 3 points to use to increase your stats. NoMUD has tons
of different zones for anyone, ranging from the level 1
newbie, to the 20th time remort, and both will find their
respective zones a challenge!

We continue to work on a new version which will include 
a more race-based system with class-style learning of spells

and keep all muds running.  So, drop by and check us out.

GOOD BUILDERS HIGHLY SOUGHT AFTER. Areas need to be science-fiction 
in nature, we are not accepting areas based on dragons, heaven, hell, 
or pure magic classes. Area building will occur for the next 3-4 months 
where we will then move into regular operation. Immortal staff positions 
will be chosen from among the playtesters and builders who help Exodus 
develop. So if you have any interest in being on the ground floor of what
should be a very interesting mud, come on and join us.

The age is 800 years after mankind developed the technology
to leave the cradle of Earth and expand his civilization to
the stars. Countless colonies now exist with only a fraction
being well established.  Some settlements are centers of
trade while others harbor criminal activity.  Some are
galactic centers of prestige while some wage war upon one
another.  This is our universe, the universe established

Description :

The lands of Basternae are ravaged by three warring factions (1) the
surface dwellers, (2) the denizens of the Underdark, (3) and the 
Enslavers, comprised of the powerful Illithids.  Basternae has many 
well honed features including:
 
 - 75000 rooms (25000 Areas, 43000 Surface Map, 7000 Underdark Maps).
 - 25 player selectable races.
 - 21 player classes.
 - Over 600 spells.
 - Almost 250 skills.
 - Player owned warships.
 - Player owned houses.
 - Player clans /w clan constructed clan halls.
 - We would like to see more roleplay, come form your own role 
   playing clan.
 
The story of the world of Basternae is a simple one, but that makes 
it noless tragic.  The world is shattered, effectively split in two 
between the surface world and that of the Underdark, a massive 
collections of caves and tunnels that runs underground.  On the 
surface, the Overlend races make their homes, while the Horde races 
either choose or are forced to live in the dangerous Underdark.  For 
all of recorded history, the Overlend and Horde races have been at 
war.  Armies march forward to combat, one side wins and slays the 
other, then is destroyed itself by another army.  It is a vicious 
cycle of warfare and neither side seems inclined to put a stop to it. 
The Overlend races talk of peace, but it's a peace that would cost 
the lives of all unclean or unpure races of the dark.  The Horde races
know only war, trained from birth to live in hostile environments.  
Horrible creatures make their homes in the Underdark, more than 
willing to kill any victims for food or sport, but it's just as likely
a young Horde member will find himself dead from the blade of one of 
his kin.
 
It's the world of Basternae, where reflexes and fighting skills are 
constantly honed to perfection, where adventure waits around every 
corner, and death can lurk behind even the most friendly of faces.  
It's a world of combat and destruction, where fame and fortune go to 
the aggressive and the meek get stomped into the ground.
 
Whether banding together with members of your faction to repel an 
invasion, or raiding rival hometowns, to simply grouping with 
guildmembers to conquer planar zones or mud-wide quests, Basternae 
offers multiple challenges.  Many players are often found sailing 
vast oceans in warships.

 
So roll your character and join the side of your choosing, maybe YOU 
can turn the tides of war!!

Description :

  Dragonlance, Forgotten realms based mud with unique classes,
skills, leveling, questing,heart thumping war and fusion systems.

  Classes are fully flexible(you can customize your skills
completely through
learning books, and can forget books if you wish to learn 
something else.)That is why we are special.
  You dont choose your class in the beginning and follow
throughout,without chance for change.

  The leveling system extends to 50, but upon reaching level 50,
you gain the ability to fuse(with another player) and restart at
level 5. This will increase your generation and give you another
level of expertise in all of your practiced skills.During fusion
any of the other players limbs and/or genes can be transferred to
you and vice versa, but be careful, genes can also be lost.

With the exception of standard weapon attacks, combat and 
spell casting time is not randomised, you employ full control
of when you cast the next spell or strike the next hit through
our unique action point system.

Description :

Welcome to the future of PK, the new version of ASSAULT:

Play in your world, this world, in our future, which we ourselves have
destroyed. And whatever is left of it... is up for the taking.

* The game features a huge ASCII world, with Millions of rooms. Yes,
millions, not thousands. The new version has oceans, an overlapping
world with no borders, and of course, more rooms.
* Build your own military base with dozens of building types and
different technology trees. Gather weapons, vehicles, bombs and armor
and use it to destroy other people or capture their technologies. The
new version features ships and boats, a new vehicle code and buying
code in general.
* Spend your spare time upgrading your stuff, the new version
features twice the building levels and complete building
customization.
* A money-based economy - buy your guns and vehicles, work for cash,
invest in banks or steal from others.
* Still has great usage of MCCP, MXP and MSP. Hear that gun firing,
or the dreaded sound of an empty clip... Right-click on map items to
see a description and command shortcuts, or download the image pack.

ASSAULT: 3.0, unlike the previous version, focuses more on the
defensive aspect of the game rather than easy kills. Breaching a
base will require more tactics and skill, and nothing is ever the
same.

You just have to stop by.

Here at the Classic RPG mud we strive to be an original while still
enjoyable mudding experience.  Based on the classic RPGs of our youth 
(ie: Early Final Fantasy series, Dragon Warrior/Quest, Breath of
Fire, and more) we tend to lean more toward gameplay than realism.
(Who cares if human dragoons can't jump 10 times thier height IRL)

We have a very unique battle system that help immerse the player
in the theme. We are still in fairly early stages and are rapidly
trying to build more areas and skills.  If you would like to take
part in the early stages of a mud where your voice as a player or
builder can really be heard and have your ideas coded this is the
place for you.

A 99% custom mudlib (a couple simul_efuns from Dead Souls) we try

Hyrule.
BUILDING -- All players are given Builder-bits and homes in
order to establish themselves in the world.
EXPLORATION AND QUESTS -- The world of Hyrule is open for

well.  Quests are given out to the daring, but the payout
can be worth it for successful quests.
CHATTING -- We have a public channel to chat with other

MAGIC AND FC APPS -- We still have a few FCs open, and when
we open Termina, we'll have several.  We also allow

Since its humble beginnings in 1991, OD has evolved into a
complex and coherent world, where muscle and magic, brawn
and brains merge, striving for experience, growth and fun.
An early decision to have absolutely no level caps for our 
players has given us a keenly trained and highly dedicated 
player population, and it is not uncommon for players to 
launch successive careers in several classes. 

Fighting strategies, training strategies, complex party
formation and just plain silliness (OD pioneered year-round
snowball fights and the infamous mage 'singalong' spell)
are hallmarks of gaming on Overdrive.

and most of them, having only just recently attained their 
abilities. 

Please note that character creation is by on-game 
application and requires a basic knowledge of the English

  It is the year 4999, and humanity struggles to recover from a New Dark Age.
Society is gripped by fear, uncertainty and superstitious as even the most
learned quake in fear the approaching end times. The very suns themselves
are fading in the sky as each year the tapestry of stars grows dimmer.

Yet among all this there is cause for hope. After a thousand years of war 
and interregnum there is an Emperor, and on the day of his coronations 
soothsayers across the known worlds say a new star was born. He has sent 
out his knights to quest after the cause of the stars' fading, to seek out 
new worlds and uncover old mysteries. At long last, humanity has heroes 
once again.

The universe of Fading Suns is a bold science fiction drama of hope,
despair and redemption, and Dark Between The Stars MUSH plays out this
interstellar passion play against the backdrop of a desperate frontier
world torn by constant catacylsm. Nobles, Priests and guilders plot, plan
and adventure for wealth, glory and honor as they explore the mysteries of
a changed planet.

Featuring three distinct spheres of RP - intrigue, questing and street
survival - DBTS realizes the award-winning Fading Suns RPG in a setting its
designers created for just the sorts of stories we want to tell. With 
exhaustive setting files and a helpful staff, even novices to the theme can
get up to speed and RPing without any hitches.

WWW         : None
Description :

 PARADOX MUD has been actively developed since early 1996 with an
extremely large and well balanced selection of skills, spells,
races and classes now well established.
 
The input/output system for the game has been designed using
best usability practices. We have attempted to incorporate a
reasonable information load with a minimum of spam to accomodate
users with special accessability needs.
 
Within the game we support Clans with their own powers, channels
and clanhalls and a peer support Guildmaster system to suggest
changes and refinements to the class system. Random restores and
damage doubling 'boosts' sweep through the world generating
orgies of violence and mayhem and adding the spice of
uncertainty to the gameplay.
 
You can customise your character before stepping into the world,
taking those skills that will best enable you to progress to the
rank of 'Hero', when new and potent powers become available to
you. Beyond the rank of Hero you can become a 'Lord', able to
swap your vital energies back and forth to achieve your own
unique balance of power.
 
When you finally reach your greatest potential as a Lord you can
undergo apotheosis and manifest as a 'Celestial': Demon, Titan
or Angel, making your choice of which new class powers to add to
your already formidable set abilities.

A new MUD based on the Wheel of Time, The Karaethon Cycle offers
players the opportunity to play crucial roles on the Wheel of Time

The MUD is still in the development phase, and is currently hiring
both builders and coders. The goal is to have a 100% original world
with a nearly entirely-rewritten codebase. 
It will eventually offer over 50 classes and 50 races from which to
choose from, a the opportunity for multi-classing and remorting, and
an infinite leveling system, as well as an entirely reworked Magic
code in which players will weave various threads of the different
elements together to cast spells. 
Guilds will be run by players and drive RP, and one can expect to
see Clan Warfare arise in the near future.

The MUD is currently open for player-testing, and those that take
part will be amply rewarded when the MUD goes officially public
(rewards which may include levels, equipment, and an automatic
remort). 
If you want a chance to jump into this craze early, and earn

enjoy.  Some offer great class/race selections, but lack in the
roleplaying environment.  Others are pure roleplay, but lack in
fun.  When I started The Inn, all I wanted to do was to make a
MUD rich in theme, and full of excitement and realism that even I
would enjoy playing on.  The Adventurers' Inn is such a place.

  All of our InnKeepers have that same desire and drive to build
the best MUD possible for our players.  Mobs that interact with
the players, objects that aren't mere weapons, but artifacts that
old great powers, and dangerous consequences.  Rooms and spells
that are lethal, and traps for the unexpecting.

  All this and more await you on The Adventurers' Inn.  Come and

  PhoenixMUD Version 4.0 has succeeded in being something more than just
your average stock circle 3.0 mud.  We have been up since March 1995 and
worked on this version for 2 years before opening it for
play.  Role-play, hack-n-slash, explore, basically do as you wish as long
as you are mature and respect others.  The immortals are usually always
around and make sure the experience is an interesting one.  The one
universal thing among our players it the feeling that Phoenix is home
regardless of good times or bad.

Description :

Hercules MUD was first created on and named after a 
SUN 3/60 named hercules at the campus of UC Irvine 
on July of 1992. The project was started using original
dikumud code. The mud moved around a bit to include 
a long stint on mudservices (until their odd demise). 
HercMUD is now located in the basement of one of its imps.
Hercules MUD is on code base V (5) now. We have 
gone through several code changes but still maintain 
our original goals to provide a unique, family-oriented, 
friendly, and safe place to relax and enjoy some company, 
whether playing or just hanging out. 

Hercules MUD is a skill and level based MUD. 
It is newbie-friendly with level-based equipment, 
some stock but many unique areas, to include a 
complete Newbie area for beginners. 

Hercules MUD is a heavily modified Circle code 
base which has OLC, DG Scripts, an online mud 
balancing feature that can adjust the mud without 
rebooting, an event system for skills, spells, and fighting, 
an auto-questing feature, a ferry system to get from 
continent to continent and many more unique challenges 
for the player.

mud is here to try and bring the life back to what was once a code of 60 +
players all playing to be the best.  The creators of Lords of War 1, 2, 3,

   The unique world of PowerMud has been around since May of 1997.  While
PowerMud was in 'Beta' stage for a while, it is currently in 'Open' stage.
The world is over 4000 rooms and is full of exotic and unique settings,
monsters, and items.

   There are Ten different races to choose from, as well as over Twenty
Guilds that you character can join.  The types of Guilds range from
Thieves, Mages, Clerics, Fighters, to other 'non-stock' guilds such as
Assassins, Monks, Merchants, Cultists, and Illusionists.  Having multiple
characters is allowed as well, so you can find a character that suits
you best.

   PowerMud uses a customized Skill system, where experience is gained for
a certain skill by actually performing that skill!  For instance, if your
character can 'hide' in the shadows, practicing doing so will raise your
skill level.  No more dividing up your experience points between non-
related skills!  As for the different skill types, there is a high number
of them, ranging from the normal combat skills (slash, blunt, pierce) to
specialized skills such as 'Advanced Melee', 'Sailing', 'Mercantile',
'Fishing', and 'Mental Attack'.

   The Developers and Players on PowerMud are friendly and easy to get
along with, and the Admins are almost always online to answer any questions
that you may have.  If you log in and experience the unique atmosphere
that is PowerMud, you will surely enjoy it.

and raunchy, while Indians battle for survival.

Lastly, FutureWorld beckons through a magical portal.
Here amazing creatures made from metallic substances can be found, and alien beings 
from unknown universes wander the streets, equally amazed at the strangeness of their

 Ah the promised land, that fabled destination of the people of Israel led by 
the legendary Moses.  Though the real Moses never got to enter the promised 
land, there is another promised land set in a very different reality of 
fantasy and medievalism...and Moses is a longtime resident.  Beware though, 
the land holds a number of dangers and demons threatening to plunge the 
world into a wilderness of sin.  You have been called forth to become a hero 
and root out the evil forces that pollute the promised land.  Trainers are 
waiting to teach you the arts of fighting and the secrets of magic, deities 
are willing to bless you with gifts that only an immortal can give.  There 
are sixty quests to conquer, three levels of difficulty, and the option of 
levelless mode. You can hack off the limbs of your opponents...or if you 
aren't careful, they can cut yours off too!  And the monsters don't kill 
people in single blows, but a well armed and armored player can take on just 
about any monster in the game at any level. For new players...unlike other 
muds, we don't require you to specify everything about your character up 
front.  You can customize your character at your own leisure during the game 
and not at the login screen.  The tour zone will teach you all the basics 
and the features, and equip you for the early going.  Stuff can be found on 
the ground all over, where you don't have to fight for it--but not always.

created. New areas are constantly being worked on and we are
always hiring new and capable builders.

Prophecy offers a playerclan system which means that players
are able to band with friends and create their own armies, guilds
or whatever they can think of. The three main clans allow those
who join to fight for the Western of Eastern armies for supremacy
or for the infamous Bearcult to try and revive Aloria.

We also offer three different types of Quest systems. Autoquests,
mob-run quests and immortal-run quests. They are quite different
and provide the players with all sorts of entertainment. Ever

Age of Destiny: La Resurreccion is an EmpireMUD run by the people who
wrote the EmpireMUD code and ran Age of Destiny and Age of Destiny 2:
Dark Destiny.  While the EmpireMUD code was never completed, many of the
planned features were implemented before the project was shut down.  This
new AoD retains all of the features of the last in-progress version of Empire
*except* Werewolves, which were neither finished, nor balanced.

The game's skill system and Vampire code are designed to resemble White
Wolf's Vampire: the Dark Ages.  Much of the Vampire code is completed,
though some disciplines are not finished.

There have been many third-party attempts to run an EmpireMUD, often
sub nominee 'AoD3' or 'AoD4', but these often fail from lack of a good
server or dedicated administration.  Age of Destiny: La Resurreccion is run
to avoid these problems, on a server that won't vanish and with a dedication
to continued service.  Play to your heart's content.

  With their mix of creative thinking and insane daring, Angel and Buffy 
changed the rules in the fight against Evil. No longer waiting to react to 
threats as they came, they began to gather the forces of good. Taking the 
war back to the legions of darkness, now they rally more and more good 
souls to their cause, to fight the good fight.

And while the maelstrom brews and the fire of war spreads across the world, 
Buffy receives portents of the sinister machinations of a powerful madman. 
Worse news is received: the six slayers she had sent to guard the new 
Hellmouth disappeared without a trace. Fearing the worse, she sends a young 
Slayer to investigate and to take up Guardianship of the Hellmouth.

This is the story of the new Hellmouth, its Guardian, her companions and 
the other unwitting pawns being manipulated during the growing storm of the 
Apocalypse.

We've been open for RP now for several months after an explosive premiere. 
Our emphasis is still on original, creative and detailed backgrounds. 
Players must be 18 or older to join. RP is both in TP form and in the form 
of 'television episodes' where main cast and player characters get involved 
in the major plots of the game. We'd love to have you. Hope to see you on

  Avalon: The First Age is a return to a time when Avalon was
savage and untamed and civilisation was just beginning to
emerge from the depths of the dark ages. There are three major
cityports - Mercinae: City of Justice and Honour and home to
the Mage, Knights, Mystics, Bards and Alchemists guilds
Thakria: The City of Miracles, home to the power-seekers and
evil guild of Sorcerers, Seers, Loremasters and Thieves.
Parrius: City of the Free, once a pirate stronghold, Parrius is
now home to the Minstrels, Warriors, Enchanters and Artisans.
Others guilds exist that are more independent; The Rangers of
the Greenwood, the peace-loving Animists and the secretive
Brigands. This land is a rich tapestry of adventure and role play
with the ultimate aim of ordination for the select few who can
stand the course. This is not a game for the faint of heart, but for
those who would stand up and be counted as legends and
leaders in their own lifetime. This is a land of unrestricted
combat incorporating the now famous Avalon combat system
in full; oft copied but never bettered.

Harry Potter: Order of the Phoenix, a newbie-friendly 
consent-based MUSH, is set during Harry's 7th and final 
year at Hogwarts.  Having recently learned exactly what 
the Order of the Phoenix is, and the precious thing they 
are guarding from Voldemort, Harry must prepare for what 
will be the fight of his life, facing increasingly 
insurmountable odds.

Lucius Malfoy has been made Minister of Magic.  Professor 
Snape has been given the Defense Against the Dark Arts 
job, and Voldemort's victory is nearly complete.  Only 
Hogwarts remains steadfast, but are the students safe even 
there?

Come to Order of the Phoenix, where you can apply for any
number of feature characters, or you can play a character 
you've made up yourself.  Our news and website and even 
our castle have recently undergone overhauls.  Plenty of 
logs of past RP are also available.

WWW         : http://
Description :

PrimeMUD while being a Godwars mud at heart has evolved
into a different type of enviornment. While the Mud is 
still very much based on the pk aspect of MUDs it now
offers more intelligant and challenging opponents 
on the npc side of things. All players on Prime are 
basically the same class, A Ki fighter. What makes 
everyone unique is their choice of racial backround
and how they choose to develop their skill set over 
time. We currently offer Humans, Saiyans, Half-Saiyans,
Nameks, Demons, and Androids as starting races and have
an expanded selection for later in the game. Even though
we're a godwars mud, characters advance through a 
level-like system which we call Ranks. Instead of training
your hp,mana, and move like a normal godwars mud these
simply go up as you play. You are given control over 
where you can spend your bonus points however. We also
removed all the stock skills and abilities. As most 
players know, they were useless in godwars anyways.

To wrap things up if you want a Unqiue Godwars mud that is
unlike any other, check out Prime. We are truely Unqiue, 
and worth your time.

There is nothing better than turning on a newbie to mudding. (IMHO)

  Check out our homepage to see what all you can do, what spells and skills
you can gain, and if your interested you can even look to see who is playing

somewhat of a mystery. Some say it was a natural catastrophe, some 
argue that the gods were angered at the arrogance of man, still 
others believe that abuse of magic was the cause. The latter was the 
most popularly held believe, and until a few years ago the practice 
of magic was shunned.

Wizard you can become mortal again (i.e. defrob/remort) and
run more quests to try and reach the level of MasterWizard.
As with most Abers, Roleplay is not encouraged and the main
emphasis on the MUD is on everyone having a good time.
The 7DOF ethos is that players should be permitted to enjoy
their MUDing experience, hence we do not have niggling
rules against quest recompletion, etc. 

We also pride ourselves on not having tell-logging or
snooping. Privacy is respected.

Description :

The Buffyverse is not open yet, but we are accepting playtesters and
those wishing to join the staff as builders or coders.  We are BtVS 
themed, picking up at an imaginary Season 8 as detailed below.  We're
looking for idea people, those who know the series well, and are
interested in being a part of our project from the very beginning. 
**********************************************************************
     In the wake of the destruction of Sunnydale, and all the
potential Slayers being activated at once, a problem became
apparent.  With the destruction of the Watcher's Council, Giles
quickly realized that he was unable to train that many slayers at
once, or even amass enough Watchers around the world to assist with
it.  So, Giles turned to the only person he could think of who might
be able to come up with a solution: Willow Rosenberg and her arcane
mystic powers.
     Willow and Giles realized that part of what had made Buffy such
the perfect Slayer was having a safe community of friends, and the
endless challenges she faced while guarding the Hellmouth.  And while
there was another Hellmouth in Cleveland, they still thought
something about Sunnydale had been of importance.
     So, using her talent, Willow reached through time & space and
brick by brick, she re-created the city of Sunnydale, California. 
She rebuilt the earth it stood on, the buildings, even people who had 
once populated the city.  After much soul searching, she did not 
create the old scooby gang, partly out of being unable to face making
those who had died, and partly to preserve her memory & privacy of 
Tara...

Description :

  The date and time are but useless things for no mortal
walked the lands known as Xenobia for a long period of
time.  It was a dismal and dark land thatchurned with
life and resources.  Once, a long time ago the lands
thrived and were populated by all manifestation of
creatures. The lands were beautiful, and power was
easily attained by those fortunate enough to wield it
correctly.  Xenobia fell into chaos with the Immortals
fighting amongst each other due to power and portfolios.
Ishtar, Mythandor, and Gealin led the charge against the
forces of evil, with Gealin’s magic, Ishtar’s control of fate,
and Mythandor’s might and lawful nature forced Necrucian
to relinquish two portfolios (Vengeance and Deceit).
Necrucian, never one to take defeat easily bestowed a
deadly curse upon Ishtar.  She did not realize the spawn of
evil Necrucian had bestowed within her; Ishtar was pregnant
with a cloned cell of Necrucian’s essence.  A week’s time
passed and Ishtar gave birth to a hideous creature, but before
they could destroy the child, Necrucian once again intervened
and swept the child from their grasp.

Description :

Red Dragon is a LIMA based mud that has been running since July 1996 and is
very stable. It features 5 primary (alpha) guilds and approximately 100
additional guilds for betas and beyond with more than 20 races to choose from,
making the possibilities nearly endless.

There is an event daemon that runs a different event approximately every 4
hours. These events range can be special heals, objects, invasions and other
things to enliven the game.

RD has a rich newbie-friendly environment that includes more than 15 different
areas, events specifically driven for newbies as well as several other bonus
features.

For the higher level player RD offers endless advancement and expansion of the
player. There are 5 distinct guilds to choose from and once you've completed
your alpha guild and/or reached level 70 you are allowed to join a secondary
alpha. If a secondary alpha guild is not to your tastes, then you are also
allowed to split one body into 2 or more. Thus giving you the flexibility of
multiple characters without having to change names and divide your time between
them. If you can't afford to split your body but wish to try out the other
guilds available, there is a reasonably inexpensive reincarnation available.

Red Dragon offers a large enough player base so there are always many people
online and yet it still feels like a community. You are not one of the
thousands of other players. The wizards/admin take your thoughts and
suggestions seriously and definitely seek new ways to expand and to incorporate
them.

yourself a Tyrannosaurus in the steaming jungles of Sosel,
wander the massive underground complex in the dead world of
Crypt, go wild in the crazy and violent place known as
Perdow...or just go dragon hunting in medieval fashion on
Welstar. Our guilds are heavily researched and we use
real life inspirations for their backgrounds.  The Templar
guild is really based on the Templars (from the titles, to
the starting equipment). Psionicists are based on the
actual principles of Chakras.  Druids are true to their
Celtic roots rather than a bunch of eco-terrorists!
 
   Not enough?  We've got over 60 races, over 20 classes,
hundreds of unique skills and spells, quests tailored to
guilds, explosive events, castles -- you name it, we've got
it.  And if we don't have it, we're working on it. It's six

Visions, it's all about fun and fantasies. Various adventures
await, as you start off as a student dreamer, and grow into a
dream walker of the world. Come in, and join the balance of order
inside of chaos...

After many months of hard work, we're finally OPEN TO THE PUBLIC!
We've been around for a little over a year now, and the immortals
have spent hard earned time working on it during this time. 
Many bugs fixed, many things fixed, all from a stock ROM, 
but completely changed. We've got Color (that's NOT joking!), 
we've got restricted PK, a validation system, a silence spell 
system, an awesome extended morgue system. A good amount of 
races, both stock and original, ***OVER 65 AREAS*** from stock 
to original, a newbie spellup and restore mob, and much much 
more! From the hands of a hard playing MUDder in the past, I 
give to you my gift, and my privilege. Enjoy Subversive Visions, 
my alternate reality. Some would wonder what our theme is, and 
it's just a place to have FUN. A good mud to play, have fun, 
with all types of themes combined. We hope to see you soon!
Thanks, and Enjoy!
                Sincerely,
                Koqlb, & the Immortal Staff

WWW         : http://www.timeoftroubles.com
Description :

 The idea for Time of Troubles began 5 years ago on paper, slowly
it advanced to a simple RoT code base where we learned the basics
of mud administration.  From here we branched out to other code
bases. At one point, I quit this project and saved it for later 
times.
 
The disk was found close to a year ago, and I loaded up a near
stock version of Sundermud2.1 (rom 2.3 derived) and began to
plug in all the ideas and code from our old beast. Slowly over 
time Troubles has developed into a beauty of a place with a 
countless amount of interesting features.  Troubles is a pk 
optional mud with a strong emphasis on class distinction. Each 
class is very unique and still being fine tuned at this moment. 
 
Troubles is an extremely indepth game with much potential and 
fun times to be had. Our Immortal staff is extremely willing to 
listen to all input, and have been doing this for many, many 
years. We have customized countless amounts of the code, but we 
will not attempt to list them here like so many other muds. We 
feel you must see Troubles to actually appreciate the indepth 
game-engine.

So please, if you would love to help run a wonderful mud full 
of potential, stop by and leave a note for Myrkul or E-mail. 
To see changes on the mud, connect and read all the Announce 
notes, then browse through "help changes."

We look forward to seeing you on Time of Troubles.

an entirely new MUDLib called RoleMUD, which offers a wide
range of features like weather, environmental stats,
colourfulness, day/night change, extralogins, interactive

  The Beutelland features fantasy themes of basically Tolkinian
flavour, but doesn't take anything too seriously.
Ardent fs/sf readers and/or computer game players
will surely encounter many allusions to classic genre
representatives.

  The World (mythically created by the holy Beuteltier (zool.
marsupial, opossum) contains differing climate/culture zones
like plains, mountains, sea, viking island, jungle.
Players can choose a hometown/region of their liking.

  Eligible races up to now include Dwarfs, Humans, Hobbits and
Elves, NPCs will show up in whatever form our coders imagination
can spawn. (Items too).

  Guilds and Trades are under construction, but we offer >20
Quests of mounting difficulty and lots of interesting details
to research, treasures to find, monsters to kill and of course
many interesting people to meet.

  If you speak (any variant of) German and don't mind persisting
Austriacisms, you will always be welcome in Beutelland.

The code represents nearly three years of redevelopment with a strong
focus on player killing code. The mud offers thirteen professions and
over 150 skills and nearly 400 spells. Players are able to gain power
through experience and player killing to raise their rank of noterity
from a common foot soldier to grandmaster of each profession.
 
Due to the muds attention to detail it does take a while for new players
to grow accustomed to the world, the playing style, and hundreds of
unique commands. Everwar immortal staff careful to spend time with new
players in order to assist them to grow comfortable with the new playing
style. The web site has a colorful player guide (25 page PDF) that

staff have started the project over, with expanded horizons. We now
encompass all RPG's as 'acceptable' (meaning that while it's impossible to
incorporate all RPG's into one MUD, admin/staff are allowed to code
anything from any RPG that they desire). We are currently looking for the
following positions:

  Builders: Build areas, and anything else simple. (Wizards only)
  Mappers: Create one of our unique detailed maps for an area already in the mud,
           or not. (Wizards and Players)
  Descers: Describe rooms that lazy wizards decided not to. (Wizards and Players)
  Playtesters: Check areas for bugs, give ideas, help with balance (Players only)

Playtesters who help test things, and do not whine about their suggestions
not being implemented will recieve special bonuses when the MUD becomes
fully operational. Note that we are NOT looking for full-time players at
this time. If you only want to play, but not help out, do not come yet. The
mud listing will be updated, as soon as the mud is truly open. Thank you.

Code Base   : [Custom]
Telnet      : dillfrog.com 4000
WWW         : http://www.dillfrog.com/games/r2/
Description :

 Running on an entirely unique code base, Rock 2 offers a welcomed diversion
to the host of Circle and Diku MUDs out there.

The game is based in a world where planar travel is possible, creating a 
vast network of environments to play in. Five advanced races war against 
each other, striving to gain control of mighty monoliths of power, which 
promise planar supremacy to those mighty enough to claim them all.

Unlike most MUDs, Rock aims to balance the playing field by using a 
real-time turn-based system. Players are given a certain amount of turns to 
use each day, allowing those with less free time to compete with the 
temporally-inclined. Players use their turns to gather equipment, improve 
their abilities and learn new skills.

Each race works as a team in an attempt to gain control of the monoliths, 
and ultimately win the game. Once all monoliths have been captured and 
secured by one race, the game ends with the winners receiving in-game 
benefits. A new game begins shortly after, providing players with a new 
chance to rule supreme.

administrative staff are enthusiastic and friendly, always
willing to help out. Saga welcomes players of all ages and
abilities, with advanced players being given the chance to
play rare species and Feature Characters.

  Players are offered a choice of three different worlds to
explore:

  ALKHABA - In the distant past, tropical jungles covered much
of the planet's surface. Ancient civilisations built shrines and
temples to Pokemon, worshipping them as Gods to be feared and
respected. Ancient Pokemon species that would eventually become
extinct still thrived in this dark landscape.
  PRESENT DAY - Pokemon training has become a way of life for
many people. Trainers travel from town to town capturing new
Pokemon to use in battle and compete in tournaments for the much
sought-after position of Pokemon Master.
  KOKUMIN - Many years from now, genetic engineering will enable
humans to create entirely new species of Pokemon. Advanced cities
cover the land, with wild Pokemon restricted to massive man-made
Biospheres.

  On this unique Pokemon MUCK, you have the opportunity to create
your own completely original Pokemon species for Alkhaba and Kokumin.
Alternatively, you can choose to play a human character: a trainer,
a breeder, or even a member of the evil Team Rocket! And, of course,
there are 386 official Pokemon species to choose from, everything
from a humble Pidgey to the mighty Lugia. The choice is yours.

Description :

 FilthyMUD has been in a period of testing and debugging for quite awhile
now, and we are now, as of September 1st, 2004, Open For Play!

FilthyMUD has had quite a bit of development, both in areas and code,
and is now very stable with a lot of original ideas implimented.  Please
visit our website to see some of these changes.

Some of the biggest changes, and the ones our playtesters love the most,
are things like our 'Per-hit-XP' system, which gives experience per hit
instead of per kill.

Our 'Endless' system, which is a two-step process, the first allowing a
max level player to continue advancing their stats (hp/mana/move) and
gain training sessions, the second is the forge item code, which allows
normal equipment to become much more powerful.
Another major change is of course remorts, but these are handled a
little differently than most muds, in that certain classes can become
certain subclasses, which are much better than the normal classes
allowed to a new character.

Again, please visit our website, which has much more information about
our MUD on it.

  You are a lowly outcast, seeking your fortune in the chaotic city known
as the Zone. Before the Great Wars, this was a magnificent city, the crown 
jewel of an advanced civilization. For hundreds of years the wastelands and
ruined cities have been the hunting grounds of savages and mutants. Now, 
the old technologies and cultures are again rising up to take back what they
once lost.

Zone Runner offers an incredibly unique game world with features unlike 
those found on any other mud. As a player, you will have the opportunity 
to mass wealth, to buy businesses and hire mercenaries and buy robots to 
literally take over the world. Enjoy spending quality time with a joint and a 
cheap prostitute. Drive around town in a Ferrari, or cruise the lake on a sleek 
waverunner.

With over 20,000 rooms and a whole host of skills and equipment needed to 
traverse the world, you will find plenty to do in this cold, cruel world. Who 
you are is up to you - would you rather be a muscle-bound brute, a skilled 
computer hacker, a shrewd businessman?... the choice is up to you.

Telnet      : paradigm.mushpark.com 2197 [67.130.96.226]
WWW         : http://None
Description :

This game is loosely based on a commercial RPG called Lightspeed
(http://www.lightspeed-rpg.com). Perhaps the best way to describe the
setting is the Federation from Star Trek versus the Empire from Star
Wars with a lot of other stuff thrown in. It's not a crossover MUSH,
so don't expect the factions to be identical to their Star Trek/Star
Wars counterparts. They are, however, similar enough that most new
players should be "instantly familiar" with the basics of the
setting.

Like most other sci-fi MU*s, PD offers a blend of RP and simulation.
We are using an original, made-from-scratch space flight and combat
engine called tSpace that is fully integrated with the skills system.
There is also a fully coded personal combat system and a
trading/economy system. Much of the code is still under development
however, so not everything is working at the moment.

The game is still under development and isn't open for RP, but the
curious are encouraged to log on and have a look around.

DARBONNE, THE FLOATING CITY

There was a time, long before the beginning of history,
when there were both good and evil forces in the Land of
Mordor.  The battles between them raged constantly with
first one side and then the other claiming victory.  It was
during the third age, at a time when the dragons and
balrogs had joined forces against the elves, dwarves and
humans in a grand assualt against them that a triad of
powerful wizards and a white mage saved the city of
Darbonne by casting a self-perpetuating spell on it.  The
spell lifted the city into the air, higher than any dragon
could fly.  Unfortunately, one of Darbonne's great
libraries was torn asunder and parchments which were stored
there, upon which were recorded offensive spells from the
realms of Earth, Wind, Fire and Water, were lost from that
library.  Mighty adventurers still seek the fragments of
those mystical parchments in many dangerous and mysterious
places.

Would you like to join them?
Styx, from the city of Oceancrest, will be your DM.

runs on a credit system that acts like gold/exp combined, but credits can't
be given away.  It is much more interesting that even I can explain.

admin, hacker attacks, and so forth. Dragonfire has a strong focus on player-

Telnet      : firedragon.com 6969 [209.161.2.50]
WWW         : http://www.firedragon.com/shadowgate/
Description :

   ShadowGate is a huge MUD that sticks closely to the AD&D
manuals. We strive to form a community of adventurers with all
aspects of interactions, both positive and negative. Look forward
to prejudice and tolerance, conflict and cooperation, hate and
love. 

   Our systems of multi-classing, races, weapon and non-weapon
proficiencies, languages, spells, deities, and required
introductions all make you feel as if the world of ShadowGate is
an evolving environment.  Indeed characters can eventually gain
influence and control over parts of the world as "High Mortals",
continuing to shape and grow the game further.

   We insist that you roleplay.  Roleplaying is a process, not
an end goal.  Each individual thread of your character's
experiences, misadventures, friends and enemies becomes the
tapestry of his or her life, and the whole winds up becoming 
more than it's parts. We strictly enforce this as best as we are
capable. We encourage RP through a system of Avatars, which are
our DM's. They are not creators or builders. They are people who
drive interactive quests through various abilities and
interactively controlled NPCs.  Avatars and creators are all
selected from the players who have played and gained our trust,
to ensure consistancy with the game's evolution forward.

   The ultimate, and perhaps idealistic, goal is to make the
ShadowGate world reflect not only the tabletop world of adventure
and RP, but also those idle times of characters - the times in the
city, spending your gold, reflecting on your adventures. We
encourage any player who wishes to become part of the community
to join us, enjoy what we have, and help us make it better and
move toward our goal.

find they can achieve success with little or no explanation.
There are several large continents to travel and explore,
separated by vast oceans. These realms are intertwined with
varying degrees of complexities which utilized different types of
terrain and themes which are appropriate to their time and
atmosphere. You will find Visionmud rich with culture, treasure,
nobility, as well as fraught with multitudes of challenges.

Of special note: I have noticed many new players to muds,
never really spend enough time to get aquainted to a new
mud. Visionmud has been designed with that in mind, and
trys hard to prevent the player from loosing interest, thusly
not dashing their hopes of reaping fame and fortune.

Shadowrun Detroit is a game based on the Cyberpunk game
'Shadowrun 3rd ed' by FASA Corporation. It is a roleplaying
MUX with judged combat and a large number of plots.  150+
active players and 30-40 on a night make for an intense
roleplaying experience. 

Shadowruns are a common experience as is general
roleplaying.  Straight combat, however, is not as common as
in TT due to the restrictions of the medium and the stress
on roleplaying versus rollplaying.

equipment; mobs load with different sets of equipment each time.
This is a challenging mud with a unique pkill system (you can
choose a path of Holy, Unholy or Amoral, or no path if you don't
like pkilling), and truly awesome rewards for upper levels. When
joining in quests, the player can earn reward points, which can
be used to increase max stats, hp, etc.  Combat on our mud is
deadly, where bleeding and exhaustion can take you down even if
you have the hp.  We also offer a Onedeath challenge, where your
character is deleted when you die (there is a Onedeath Hall of
Fame also to record those valiant players).  We have long time

Description :

   The MUD is in its 2nd year of heavy code modifications
and area creation. We have only 2 simple rules to follow,
and a huge number of skills/spells, as the primary theme of
the MUD is simple: Make the players as powerful as they can
possibly be, while increasing the difficulty of the game to
adapt to your increase in power, which quickly eliminates
boredom.

   The game, which is fantasy-based, is pure PK, and all of
our players are always more than willing to help out new
ones.  This includes Immortals, who are prohibited from
being lofty, invisible creatures whose sole purpose is to
harass players and prevent them from having fun.  Players
can remort once into another class, with both classes
consisting of 100 levels, and once into the powerful Hero
class.  You can watch players battle it out in an arena, as
though you were walking along right beside them.  Battles
will be legendary in their magnitude, consisting of entire
towns (and players if they wish to join) destroying each
other, some for the pursuit of power and wealth, some just
to watch the other side perish.  Enter our world.

  The year is 2043 AD on Earth and in the future things were
seemingly bleak. Not to long ago in 2028 World War Three broke
out and threw the governments of the world into chaos. After six
long years the world united as one and what was once pain and
suffering rapidly became entertainment. Without national barriers
and even no language barriers entertainment became a large focus
while other research went bankrupt due to lack of funding. Come
the year 2040 Internet gaming was the top grossing form of
entertainment and any company that hoped to earned money was in
on the business. One research company known as Faust & Solomon
Enterprises decided to corner the market with a new development.
They created a new gaming system and game. They packaged it as
one with one name Hirladan. That was the name of this believed
virtual world, though in truth it was part of a research test.
Using mental images and skills a person knew to create a sprite
to exist in another world. While these sprites that uses
amplified and modified skills such as a creative writer being a
good spell caster, they also knew they could test resurrection
and even duplication because ‘NPCs’ must be killed. A wizard to
the north found these seemingly undying sprites, while struck
down they rose again so to further his plots to take the
struggling world he must stop the influx of immortals. A spell
was developed and for two years people have been disappearing in
the real world and hybrids of the character they were and who the
look like have been showing up in game un able to log out as the
spell merges body and mind into Hirladan.

  It is possible for very unique creation as one can range from
players to natives and even the trapped playes if one chosese to
do so. So please stop in and give it a look see.

'Dragonriders of Pern' by Anne McCaffrey, and runs with full permission from
the author. We attempt to recreate, with as much authenticity as possible, the
atmosphere and society described in the books. Set in the Southern Continent
of Pern we are set in the 10th Pass, one pass after the events in
Dragonflight, The White Dragon etc. We do not recognize the events outlined in
'All the Weyrs of Pern', and therefore Thread still falls, though technology
remainsl very limited.
 
SouCon MUSH is PernMUSH's sister game, and an ideal place to send a PC
relative of a character you have here: we're running on the exact same
timeline! Smaller than PernMUSH, SouCon offers a more intimate atmosphere for
RP.
 
Currently, we have 2 Weyrs (mountainous Honshu and jungle-covered Southern), 2
Holds, and many Crafts, offering characters many ways in which to get
involved.  We have 4 Hatchings a year, and Impress up to 10 players at each
Hatching on average.
 
We consider ourselves one of the friendliest MUSHes out there, and offer help
to new players of all levels of experience. Please join us at:
soucon.silvertree.org: 4201 (63.199.182.123: 4201), and feel free to contact
any of the Wizards or Guides (+rwho wiz and +rwho gui) for help!

Description :

   Welcome to the Shattered Realms. Our world began in
June of 1999, and has been under constant construction
for the last few months. We are now open for beta
testing, and encourage constructive criticism. We are
a fully interactional LP MUD, with nine different races
and eighteen classes. From the high heights of the
Northlands, to the deep mysteries of the UnderDark,
our world is rich in every detail. Roleplaying is
encouraged, and rewarded within our xp system. As a
large part of Roleplaying involves taking risks (what
warrior would be afraid of battle if he knew he would
not die) we also permit playerkilling. I have found that
the real danger provided by this makes the gaming
experience much richer. Newbies, fear not, for we have a
newbie-friendly interface and protection for one full day
of game time. Come visit the Shattered Realms. 

We also have positions available for coders at all
experience levels. From builder, programmer and writer
all the way up to admin levels currently available.
We prefer LP MUD experience and a strong desire to build
your dreams for  others to enjoy them. 

The Shattered Realms - a place unlike any other.

Description :

  Happy Mud started roughly 9 years ago in UTexas, Austin, eventually moving to LVC,
and then to paid hosting services such as mudsrus.  We have now finally migrated to an
ex-player's server and are currently running very nicely there.  Nearly every pfile is
still present.  Please send an email if you wish to have your character back.

  We have finally completed our personal Happy Area Creator, a windows GUI/program which
is very helpful in designing areas for Happy MUD.  The program comes complete with
installer and a sample area (from stock greed code) and is available at our website.

  Current features include: three remort choices, which determine which of 28
superclasses you can choose, 20 different theme based worlds, debatably the most advanced
autoquesting code, 'undo spell' spells, ressurection spells, pc repair of weapons and
armor,  50 levels for remorting, 950 continuous non-remort levels for superclasses,
nifty naming (easier to reference objects), nearly every sentient NPC can have a
conversation, surging for superclasses (spend more mana to enhance every spell effect
(duration, damage, etc.), along with mastery skills that enhance the efficiency of this), 
etc.

WWW         : http://www.british-legends.com/
Description :

Multi-User Dungeon, or MUD for short, was the first ever game of this genre.
For many years, MUD, or British Legends as it was known to players, existed
on the CompuServe Information Service. In the fall of 1999, however, CIS
decided to terminate British Legends as part of their Y2K cleanup efforts.
Many players thought that this meant the end of their beloved game.

That is not so. The present incarnation is a high-fidelity port of the
original MUD code base to a modern server platform. This accurate
reimplementation faithfully reproduces almost all the original's features,
even some of the bugs that have become part of the game's lore.

If you want to see what multiplayer gaming was like in the Land where it all
began, and visit a game that still offers superior game play and balance,
a visit to MUD at http://www.british-legends.com/ will be worth your time!

This version of MUD/BL was written with the permission of the original
copyright holder by Viktor T. Toth (aka Viktor the arch-wizard, formerly
MrSpock the wizard) in a 'mad programming binge' (as MUD's original author,
Richard Bartle called it) in December 1999, and has been in limited
operation on a test site since. It was opened to the public in May, 2000.

Description :

One thousand years ago, superstition and the sword ruled.
It was a time of darkness.
It was a world of fear.
It was the age of Gargoyles.
Stone by day, warriors by night,
They were betrayed by the humans they had sworn to protect,
Frozen in stone by a magic spell for a thousand years.
Now here in Manhatten.
The spell is broken.
And they live again!
They are defenders of the night,

THEY ARE GARGOYLES!

The age of darkness has long passed and modern nights are filled
with danger, and something far more. The angels of the night are
collecting by some force or pull to the land called New York. While
most of the world below is blissfully unaware of the existance of
these creatures, a rare few are privilaged to this information. Some
call themselves friends to Gargoyles, while others have made it their
life's work to destroy them. Tension runs high between different
groups of gargoyles that have begun to form. Some seek to remain
hidden from the eyes of the humans, protecting from the darkness.
While others seem not to care if the humans discover their existance.
The followers of the old ways war against those who seek to destroy
the humans. The Quarrymen plot to destroy all gargoyles. Silent battles
in the night...
 
( Note: This game is Disney's Gargoyles based. It is fully operational
but the world is not totally built yet. Input is very welcome. )

Description :

A growing medieval based MUD, we are seeking builders for the most 
part at this time. We are also open for player testers, but the 
thing we need most now is a larger building staff. Going for an all 
original world, we currently have only 4 stock zones, and even those 
will eventually be replaced. Theme will be largely medieval, so any 
builders would preferably be able to stay within theme. A large race 
selection offers more variety for areas, still needed are a few 
race hometowns. Quest areas are also welcomed, so anyone able to 
create a nice challenge are welcome also.

Opening to players once the world is large enough to support a 
small playerbase, so the more builders we have, the sooner we will 
be ready. Any questions are welcomed to be emailed, or stop in and 
speak to Scynscapa or Rayen.

Player testing is welcome, but we are not yet ready for players. At 
least one more playerfile wipe will be necessary. However, testers 
will have a few advantages upon opening. Playtesters are needed to 
check zones for errors and balance, as well as to aid the testing 
of new features; hence the testers will have an advanced knowledge 
of the MUD when we are ready for players.

crossover where feasible and desired, and providing boundaries
where necessary. The only requirements here are an open mind and

WWW         : http://mem.zapto.org
Description :

Middle Earth Mud is a Multi-User Dungeon (MUD) based on Tolkien's
Middle Earth. It is a text world in which players can create a 
character and then play it as if it were truely Middle Earth. It 
is set after Bilbo has returned from Erebor (after the events of 
The Hobbit) and before he leaves the Shire after his party (before 
the events of The Lord of the Rings). It is completely free to play. 
It was built by Tolkien fans for Tolkien fans.

Middle Earth Mud's mission statement is to create an accurate and
realistic representation of Tolkien's Middle Earth, as close as may
be done in a MUD environment. Roleplaying is strongly encouraged. 
Out of character play, while tolerated to a certain level, is 
strongly discouraged. There is a war between the forces of the Dark 
Lord and the Free Peoples of Arda.

Currently MEM is centered around Bree and Breeland.  Players may 
choose to play a Dunadan man, Eriadorian man, Black Numenorean,
Dunlending, Dwarf or Hobbit.  Black Numenoreans and Dunlendings 
are in league with Mordor.  There are currently about 14 zones 
open with about 1500 rooms.  MEM's playerbase is virtually
non-existent right now.  We are working on building one.  Come 
join us and be the foundation of our player base!

MEM is not just a hack and slash MUD.  Should players choose they 
may learn a craft and aquire a building in Bree to be their shop.
Warriors, rangers and thieves may also aquire buildings to be their
homes or to be used for whatever they like.

We are currently hiring dedicated builders who will work hard and
finish what they start. The world will continue to grow slowly
unless we have devoted builders who love Tolkien.  The current 
building team can only build so fast.  Manwe can write brilliant
code until his fingers fall off, but with out a well built and large
world, there is no where for players to enjoy that code.  So, if you
love building and love Tolkien come build with us!

away. Things you held this morning have been swept away in the tidal wave of 
violence that will be known as the Great Disaster.

New races are being born as we speak, magic is coming alive in ways never 
dreamed possible. Technology and magic now co-exist in a place that knew 
only how big the next person's blaster was.

So, join us as we mourn the lives lost in the cataclysmic war, and focus on 
bringing new life into a world that was quickly dying away.

WWW         : http://slothmud.org/
Description :

For 15 years, SlothMUD III has been one of the most successful MUDs of
its kind. Sloth is a heavily modified Diku which offers a unique world
of more than 20,000 rooms, inhabited by 8,000 people and creatures. 
 
In SlothMUD III, each player advances in four classes chosen from 
bard, cleric, druid, mage, monk, necromancer, thief, and warrior. 
In addition to the skills and spells of his basic four classes, our 
multi-class system provides special powers to each "prime" class. As 
a result, the hundreds of possible class orderings have distinct play 
styles. Once a player reaches maximum level in his four initial 
classes, a prestigious fifth class opens up which gives him entirely 
new skills and powers as well as access to a dangerous but rewarding 
expert-level continent. 
 
Sloth provides its immortals with a unique scripting language, 
allowing them to build areas that are interactive to an unprecedented 
degree. These areas include complex puzzles, hundreds of scripted 
quests, and monsters that behave in surprising and intelligent 
ways.  Several areas provide more than simple hunt-and-kill; 
these include a PvP arena and a coliseum where the player can 
test his mettle against an ever-nastier series of monsters. 
 
SlothMUD III also offers a very active immortal and administrative 
staff, constantly working to provide new and interesting experiences 
to challenge players. We are one of the most newbie-friendly MUDs 
around, with many experienced players willing to assist you in
learning and enjoying our game. We look forward to seeing you soon!

WWW         : http://www.smile.ath.cx/
Description :

   SMiLE is an abermud which supports player killing.  The
object of the game is to obtain 30+ quest points and get
200,000 points to make wizard.  Points can be gained by
solving puzzles and quests, killing mobiles and other
players (if you have the killer flag) and dropping items of
value in one of the two sacrificial pits.

The type of character you play is your choice. You may
choose to run a killer, play nice and merely defend
yourself when attacked, or something in between.  Playing
the mud as a player killing mud will increase the challenge
you experience while running.  Player killing also gives
you the opportunity to try to outwit human players who are
less predictable than computer generated mobiles. You also
have the choice of playing the mud as a nonplayer killing
mud.  Which ever style you choose to play, the mobiles of
SMiLE are more challenging than in some other muds.  The
game has a complete combat system with weapons, armor and
spells.  Weapons and armor are abundant and with a bit of
exploration you can increase your magical knowledge.

Description :

Renegade's Ascension - The mortals paradise

History/Background:
Renegade's Ascension, which first was a part of BurningMUD 
before BurningMUD gods decided that the MUD had to split 
into two different MUD's due to different reasons,  is now 
a forwardgoing and developing MUD on it's own. The MUD is 
a non-playerkilling-MUD based on DIKU. All players on 
Renegade's Ascension lives under the same roof -Everyone 
got the same 
hometown - Moonglade.
 
Leveling-system:
Renegade's Ascension's leveling-system is made up that you, 
first off, gain experience to level 50 as a single-classed 
character and therefrom you Multi class. Multi classing 
means that you choose a second class and startover as a 
level 1/50, let us say, Magician(second-class)/Templar
(first-class), this means that you can use all the 
spell-abilities Magicians and Templars has - except those 
who are for pure classed only - Templar/Templar e.g. 
However, when being Multi classed you can only gain 
1/3 of the amount max experience that you could gain 
when you were single classed. Things become more 
even when reaching to 50/50 though since then the max 
experience barrier disappears and you can begin to Meta. 
Meta means that you buy stats instead of levels, Metas 
however, costs BOTH exp and gold and you NEED to buy a 
fixed amount of stats until you can gain another level. 
The amount of stats needed to be bought depends on what 
class you are.

The Well:
The Well is a place where you can gain frags and more cash 
than you can in experience-groups, frags is something you 
need if you want to upgrade your race - Little is actually 
known about these powerful beings except that they command 
great energies with an ease unheard of in current times. 
In some tales these beings are being referred to as the 
"K'ta'viir" - which literally means 'lords of essaence' 
in the Iruaic tongue. Being a K'ta'viir can benefit you 
in many ways, for an example, you can invoke different 
Orbs turning to Auras that benefits your character 
depending on what kind of Orb it is, there is also other 
special features for the K'ta'viir, but we think that you 
should explore that on your own. The Well is based on 25 
levels, starting at level one - getting harder for each 
level, however, more frags can be found in the 
well-creatures-corpses if they're on level 25 than if they 
are on level one. The Well contains many different 
monsters, everything from a cloaker to a mighty Balrog. 
Orbs for the K'ta'viirs can also be found inside the Well.

       Welcome to Eternal Oasis, soon to be the realm that will  
quench your thirst for both an excellent atmosphere of roleplay 
as well as a well developed multi-user environment.  Eternal Oasis 
is a multi-user dungeon in it's infancy.  We have a great base of  
coders that are helping to create a wonderfully detailed and well 
coded world to explore. 
      
       Our story begins in a world that resembles Earth, but one 
which houses many things that defy our own reality.  The realms of 
Eternal Oasis are at a dawning of a new age.  A great catastrophe  
broke the world and scattered the reminants into small secluded groups, 
where they grew and changed in seclusion.  Now, centuries have passed,  
civilizations are on the rise and sea traffic is starting up, new  
discoveries are being made, races strive for survival and others  
venture into hazardous territories to uncover things that have been 
lost to the past under the ruins of ancient kingdoms.

      Our theme is medieval fantasy, however we are very carefully 
reaching into new levels of fantasy which other muds have failed to 
achieve, whilst also keeping a tight hold on reality, all resulting in 
a very interesting twist which offers roleplayers an excellent  
environment to enjoy.

there are more but I wont list them here do to space restraints, plus any good ideas that
you have will be considered. Our website is still under construction, but hopefully it will

Description :

 Star Wars: Dark Warriors is an extensively modified version of SWR 1.0. 
Our additions to the code are focussed mainly on improving the believability 
of the SWR mudding experience. By our way of thinking, the goal of role 
playing is a mimicry of real life, but with various fantastic aspects added

WWW         : http://www.spheresmux.net
Description :

   Spheres is a role playing environment very loosely related to Jack L. 
Chalker's Well World series.  Essentially the game world consists of an 
infinite plane of spheres, and  within each sphere is a snapshot of a
different realm.  

For example, there is a sphere in which gryphons rule over their medieval
jungles, and another in which centaurs are making the dangerous traversal 
from the nuclear age to the information age.  Focus is made upon the
interaction of travelers migrating across different, foreign spheres.
Players are encouraged to develop their own tinyplots, or even conceive
and design their own spheres to add on to the game.  This is a solidly in
character environment; if your looking for a place to hack and bash, or be
all-powerful this isn't the game for you.  There is no combat system, and
no plans to ever develop one.  

We consider ourselves very newbie friendly, and are willing to spend the
time to help familiarize people with our theme.  All that is necessary to
play in the game is to have read the news files pertaining to our theme
'news theme' and the info files regarding your species.  (Type 'info'.)
If your interested in serious, exciting role play then come on out and
welcome!  Others should apply elsewhere. :>

   Split Infinity is a mud of a wide variety of themes,
stretching across multiple planets.  The 3D space supports
spacecraft and even combat, similar to the 3D ocean system.
Mechs will be used among the elite in futuristic warfare,
matched evenly by the gurus of magic and psionics.  Melee
combat is further improved by the martial arts, mastering
deadly combinations of moves to defeat ones opponent.

   There are no classes, but instead a huge list of skills.
Skills will need to be reinforced in training to retain 
mastery.  There will, however, be guilds, which players may
join and gain valuable allies, perhaps dangerous enemies.
There is a large selection of races, some of the common
ones being split up into subraces, each with their own  
statistics, some with inheritted skills and resistances,
were creatures actually being able to morph as well.  

   If you want to be a part of a well-written,
revolutionary mud, we do still recruit programmers and
teach non-programming good writers with a simple
application process.  If interested, telnet si.nu 4000

 Rancor is a highly-modified ROM 2.4, medieval fantasy,
role-playing-encouraged MUD.  Our mud is stable, and has
been so for over 3 years.  As stated above, we highly 
encourage role-playing, but we don't enforce it, making our 
mud ideal for anyone, role-player or not.  We have a
brand new quest system, created specially by our best 
coder.  We offer player killing and player stealing.  We 
also offer clans; however, because we do not force you to 
join a clan, the choice to kill/steal from other players 
and to be killed/stolen from is yours.  We have an arena of 
sorts, in which you can either have a 'bloodbath' with 
multiple people, or can fight one on one, regardless of 
whether you are in a clan or not.  Furthermore, we have 
extended race selection, giving plenty of freedom in
that department, as well as several rounded classes.  As if 
all this isn't enough, we'll soon be coming out with a 
brand-new mud (oddly enough, it's being called Rancor II) 
that is coded much cleaner and will have better routines 
and systems, such as a new combat system.

We've been receiving a number of new or returning players, 
as well.  We hope you'll be one of them!

you can be the knight in shining armor or the dragon who snatched

   Adesa has been forged from a heavily modified version of Ack!
and while it still offers the Ack! standards like autoquesting,
there are quite a few new wrinkles to the old system.  Every race
has been tweaked to provide its own distinct advantages and the
mortal class to remortal class match-ups have been improved.  We
even have a totally unique lawful/unlawful player killing system.

   This mud is a constantly growing and changing place, where old
players as well as new will continue to find challenges.  Brand
new areas, many with mobprogram puzzles and new items, are being
added almost every week.

Description :

    Although RIFTs is a highly combat and power oriented RPG, Rise From Chaos is about
building relationships and telling entertaining stories, while exploring a fantasy life in a
science fiction setting. Tolkeen is a frontier kingdom, a haven for those who would be
persecuted elsewhere for their differences. The city-state is itself one link in a short
chain of alliances, their goal - survival against the many enemies at the doorstep: the
Coalition (a human supremacist, military organization); predatory dimensional beings
(D-Bees); supernatural entities whose thoughts and purposes are too alien to comprehend; as
well, humanity's own personal demons, living amongst and within - ignorance, power-lust, and
vice.

    The PCs of RfC live in a dangerous and mysterious world. Tolkeen's own secrets, of her
origin and her survival, are yet to be discovered. Should you choose to take part, your
impact upon this enduring quest will enrich the story today, and the story still untold.

    The kingdom has been built to allow extensive travel outside the main city, offering
many varied environments for storytelling. This MUSH is ideal for self-motivated writers
with good attitudes and keen wits.

both friends and rivals. You have the ability to create a unique
character by choosing from: 19 unique races, a primary-,
secondary-, tertiary-, and specialized pilot-class to create your
very own specialized experience.

  You will bond with Mace Windu as he comes to your aid, and
fear Boba Fett if you warrant him tracking you down in his sleek
new Slave II in any of the well-beyond 100 zones that make up
Revenge of the Jedi! Don't go to Dathomir alone, unless you're
feeling lucky. You might lose more than just your hand. If you
forget the hyperspace coordinates to Tatooine, I hope you
remembered a comlink, or have a working nav-computer. I recommend
this game for all Star Wars fans, for both new and experienced
players of text-based games. So join us at jedi.betterbox.net
port 9400. Come see why our mud is as good as everyone says it
is.

Adventure, excitement... a Jedi DOES crave these things!

The stars have fallen, burning away all the world except one last city, whose name is 
Armageddon. The sun has turned black and burst, fragments dissolving into a terrible 
silver sky. Two-thirds of the blood-red moon shine balefully  in the night sky, 
illuminating demons, angels, and humans caught in the war of which the Revelation of

Earth's resources were used up and man had approx. 60 years to find 
resources and colonies to save our world. World unites, after the

salvation. This first vessel, the StarQuest, mysteriously vanishes and 
the game starts with the building of the second to solve this mystery.

StrangeMUD - where thinking might become a prerequisite(tm).

StrangeMUD is a dynamic, growing mud that's been up for approximately two 
years now, and is constantly adding players, areas, skills, and nifty new 
code.  Our theme is 'Anything Goes'.  We're wacky and zany, and have the 
mobs to prove it - from Elvira, who gets _really_ peeved if you pinch her 
tush, to Bill Clinton, who wanders around town cleaning up the Whitewater 
affair.  Most, if not all of our areas have 'interesting' mobs - that is, 
those who don't just sit there while you kill them.  Mob progs and spec 
procs were added to tons and tons of mobs to make playing here a more 
remarkable experience than it already is.

It should be pretty clear that we're proud of our mud, with good reason.  
Years of work have gone into it, and it's a damn fine mud, with great 
gods and players.

   Styx is a fantasy based LP mud. It is one of the oldest
games around -- Our areas are large (5 continents) and we

system of government with players as rulers of continents
with control of taxes, courts, castles, intercontinental
relations and much more. We have 10 unique classes - each
with their own skill set, no surrogate guilds.

You can have as many chars as you like and you can roll
your stats as many times as you want. 

We maintain an anti-censorship policy. The administration
does not go around telling you what you can or cannot do. 
(Due to this we have rated the mud R :-) We are instead busy
making the mud a better place for you.

A versatile and hard working coder staff changes and
improves Styx on a day to day basis. We place great
mportance on presentation and if you have 
color capabilities, you will be pleasantly surprised over 
our user-friendly color system that lets you set different 
colors for almost every conceivable type of message.

castles.

 Co-operating with other players is encouraged, as the players can not solve
most of the quests just by themselves, but need an organized party. Players can
build castles where they can store equipment. The castles are fully
customizable, allowing custom descriptions, and guards, traps, doors and other
items. Examples of guilds players can join are fighters, berserkers, priests,
magicians, sorcerers, necromancers, abjurers and so on.

 Player killing is allowed for certain limits if the killer has a valid
reason. Generally, the world of SumuMUD is is a complex place where you act as
you would act in real life in similar environment.

- Distinctive fighting styles including brawler, fencer, soldier,
  taoken, gladiator, berserker, knifer, staff fighter, wardancer

  witchcraft, beastmastery, craftsmanship, medicine, apocruphyc
- Player-run factions which can build fortresses, hire NPC
  assistants, collect treasure, and ally and declare war

- Hundreds of special abilities to customize your character, such

Dusk is also refreshingly free of annoying mud-isms such as rent,
corpse retrieval (combat is non-fatal), hunger & thirst, and
arbitrary command delay.  Every element in the game is designed for
exactly one thing: to enhance the fun of your experience!

If you're tired of trolls, hobbits, magic missle, bash, and glowing
jewel-bedecked swords of uberpower, then this is the mud for you.

We also have a focus on making it easy for players without a lot of
time to devote to the game to play and still find it enjoyable.  Of
course there are plenty of "elder games" for those that do have a lot
of time to spend.  Dusk accomodates many styles of play.  It's even
possible to play a character with no combat skills whatsoever.

Now six years old, Dusk's diverse playerbase is as friendly as they
are devoted.  Log on today and see what you've been missing.

from interactions with the magick and the fae... humans have

more classes...

We currently have:

Back online after a month of moving the server and having a lot of things stolen from my store-room.. but back in buissness.

Description :

 Welcome to Yet Another Dystopia Mud!  The areas are all stock so
far, because I'm concentrating on coding changes for now.
 
Speaking of coding changes, here's some of the big ones.  New
classes!  The first new class, Shade, is currently in development
and balancing, and the upgrade to Shade is next in line.
Kingdoms have been changed into Religions, and each religion will
have unique powers.  A new buy command allows one to buy color,
weapon, and stance levels to take the tedium out of spellbotting
and training.  To keep mastery slightly challenging, it now costs
exp in addition to the normal mastery costs.
 
Drop by and try it out!  I'm almost always on, until I get a job,
anyways.  My few regular players could use some new challenges,
are you one to provide them with one?

Description :

 Alien Contact.  Something Humans have long dreamed of.  The knowledge that we are no longer
alone in this great big Universe.  The ability to communicate with species so much more
advanced than us, exchange ideas, and live in harmony with the Universe.

This MUX has nothing to do with that.

WAKE UP!  Earth has been discovered by Aliens and their teenagers are enrolled in our
schools, shopping in our malls, and eating the same fast food.  High School is never going
to be the same again.  Tribbles are going to date your kid sister and silicon based life
forms are going to poke at lunch and wonder exactly what the heck it is.  Wait a
sec...perhaps it won't be so different after all.

You'll find yourself partying down with Near Humans & Real Weirdies, have epic adventures
battling the Alien Control Officers and defeating the Xerox copies from Neptune while
finishing your homework on time so you can go out Friday night.  You thought dragons were
tough?  Wait until you meet the Vice Principal.

Teenagers From Outer Space MUX is based on the popular Anime/Silly RPG by R. Talsorian
Games.  It is a pure Roleplaying MUX with RP enforced.

WWW         : http://www.stickmud.org
Description :

  StickMUD is a fairly traditional LPMUD. It still carries
some features of the origianl LPMUDs, but most of the game 
is unique to Stick. StickMUD has been around over 10 years 
now, and still has some of its original or early coders and 
players around. This tightly knit group creates the 
athmosphere of StickMUD.

StickMUD has no real level or stat limits for your 
character. Your character can evolve forever, though, the 
higher levels can be very difficult to reach. In fact, 
StickMUD was one of the first, if not the first, LPMUD to 
extend the 20-level playing experience.

Stick has a number of distinct races and guilds to choose 
from. Each guild has its loyal supporters and favorite 
races. Guild wars and disputes are fairly common, since we 
allow limited player killing and fairly liberal self 
governance for players.

StickMUD has a loyal group of supporters who keep playing 
year after year, but the game is easy for newbies as well.
You are welcome to play with us.

NOTE: We are currently adding new areas and a new universal
skill system.

 Tempora Heroica is a free-to-play, text-based online game known to most people
as a MUD or multi-user dungeon. The mud has over eight years of development and
has many things that distinguishes it from other online games, including a magic
system based on Ars Magica and a detailed, well-written, scratch-built fantasy
game world that has a quirky, small-town atmosphere and is filled with colorful
players and NPCs.

Tempora Heroica has several features to assist new and first-time players,
Such as an expansive in-game help system that is constantly being updated and
expanded and a on-demand mapping system that provides a 9x9 grid of the
surrounding area. For players who enjoy diversity, TH has many races available
for play: humans, halflings, giants, trolls, ogres, gnomes, dwarves, goblins,
elves, selkies, pixies, and brownies.

Additionally, the experienced mudder that is looking for a new home will find
play on TH rewarding. Not only have the normal things that you can find on
every-other-mud been added, such as houses, customizable color, dynamic socials
for enhanced role-play, and stackable aliases. But, what really makes this MUD
different, is its hard-working staff that really sweats the little details that
makes the MUD come to life!

 The latest installment of the Southern Cross line. A thousand

complete poverty. There is no true middle class anymore. You
are a have, or have not. The have nots often taking jobs from
the haves in hopes of a few extra eGil to fill their accounts.

The 'furry' races are more rare these days, but still quite 
present as a minority group. Joining them are bioconstructs,
servants created in test tubes for the wealthy. Also, those

Description :

   Starlane is an abstract, multi-player, network, real-time,
persistent-world strategy game of intersteller empire-building and
diplomacy. Starlane players take on the role of leaders of a galactic
power group, issuing commands to units such as starships, bases and
armies in order to achive their chosen goals; be they survial,
prosperity or galactic domination.

While player's orders are processed in real time and take effect
immediately, Starlane was designed to be played over an extended period
of time, with negotiations between players occuring through e-mail. The
ideal Starlane game would involve tens (or hundreds) of players,
thousands of star systems, and the kind of Byzantine diplomacy that
would make Kofi Annan want to curl up and die.

Starlane requires the download of a custom Java client.

Description :

  Entering its 12th year of existence, ThunderDome can now boast of being one
of the longest running MUDs in the history of the internet.  In those years,
ThunderDome has done much to advance the quality of game play, while adding
much to the notions of what a diku-style mud should be. Tdome offers a dark,
and at times, humorous perspective on a futuristic world set sometime after
the earth's destruction. Human society,  formed mostly of roughly governed
gangs, must now contend with aliens and mutated beasts for control of tdome's
13k rooms. Toward that end, players can choose between 13 different classes,
and are allowed to log 3 of these characters on at once.

Guns (dozens are offered) and magic vie for superiority in the tdome
world, while biological implants and learned skills offer additional methods
by which a character might improve his lot in a life filled to the brim with
danger and adventure. Inexperienced players soon learn that the inherent
danger can be tempered by joining one of tdome's many gangs which offer a
variety of advantages. Sanctioned gangs have their own bunkers from which
to operate, and which offer cut rate rent costs and equipment repair.

If you are the sort that enjoys walking on the wild side, come seek the
challenge of survival in a world gone mad. There should be plenty of room
to accommodate you...Hell ain't half full yet. :)

often a stop for travellers also giving the most motley assortment of peoples to be found.
Finally the third land, one that has tried to rebuild the advancements that humans once
had, is a slowly rebuilding reminder of the post-apocalyptic future that humans have had
to endure. Controlled by the iron fist of a General, this land ranges from the broken
runes of the old world to newer buildings and some suspect hidden technologies.

Description :

   TinyTIM is the world's oldest continual MU* in existance. We have a
blistering social scene with frequent headache-producing events and various
other things that make your stomach hurt. Most people never live through
the experience, but that doesn't stop them. Our wizards are utterly arbitrary,
and we've been known to turn people into lawn chairs for using the letter
'o' in their name.
   
   We have a Pern Weyr that's really nice, except the carpeting is very ugly.
Come on down and hang out in the TinyTIM Main Area Place (the Nexus), which
we stole from TinyHell and they can't have it back, the bastards. It likes
us better anyhow.

   We're run by a cow and a fish and some Klingons and a few dragonriders and an
ancient Native American god and a guy who's really both a guy and a girl, plus
some others. Sometimes it gets confusing, and often frightening. But hey, you
only live once. Oh! Nearly forgot. We're not just a big game; we're a REALLY
big game.

The Wheel of Time turns and Ages come and pass. What was, what will
 be, and what is, may yet fall under the Shadow. A world of kings,
queens, and Aes Sedai—women who can tap the True Source and wield
 the One Power.
At the moment of Creation, the Creator bound the Dark One away from
 the world of humankind, but more than three thousand years ago, Aes 
Sedai, then both men and women, unknowingly bored into that prison 
outside of time. The Dark One was able to touch the world only
lightly before the hole was soon sealed over. But the Dark One's 
taint settled on saidin, the male half of the Power, and every male 
Aes Sedai went mad. In the Breaking of the World they destroyed 
civilization and changed the very face of the earth, sinking 
mountains beneath the sea and bringing new seas where land had been.
Now only women bear the title Aes Sedai, men still are born who can 
learn to channel the Power, or worse, who will channel one day 
whether they try to or not. Doomed to madness, destruction, and death
 by the taint of the saidin, they are hunted down by the Aes Sedai
and gentled, cut off forever from the Power for the safety of the 
world. 
Explore new lands in search of lost treasures and artifacts. We have 
more than 10,000 rooms open and many more on the way.
Pit your skills in battle against the trolloc horde or the human 
infestation!
Roleplay you character to its fullest potential and gain acceptance 
to and possibly lead one of our numerous clans!
For the darkside we offer the following clans:
Gho'blin,   Dha'vol,  Kho'mon,  Al'ghol,  Ko'bal, Chosen,  
Draghkar (soon to come) with hard work and much dedication trollocs
can first become master then eventually become Myrddraal or Gray Men
For the Lightside we offer:

Description :

 In ages past, before the great kingdoms of the east were 
sacked, before the Age of Greed's great fervor, far before 
U Po Kyin's ascension which led to these days, it was an 
Age of relative peace.

An Age of Discovery.  When people attended to the minutia 
of their lives, and when the bounds of the world were unknown.  
To the east, The Barrier was impassible.  And experimenters 
speculated about what the meaning of life might be.  And 
adventurers sought to know what lay beyond the farthest 
mountain.

Today we know the edge of the world.  We have heard of the 
giants and beasts who once slept, who sleep again.  We have 
felt the rumble of war approaching.  We have seen our great 
kingdoms succumb to creatures bred, summoned, and created.

Knowledge has given us this Age.  When we know the value of 
life.  When we know a rivalry can live forever.  The 
pursuit of immortality drives us all.  No respect for life.  
No alliances.  No trust.  This is the Age of Insanity.

In the latter half  of  the  year 2344,  the USS Enterprise NCC-1701-C
responded to  a  distress call from the  Klingon Outpost  at  Narendra
Three.   After engaging the Rihannsu warbirds attracking  the outpost,
the Enterprise  and   her  crew were thrust twenty-two years into  the
future... and did not return. 
 
It  is now 2345,  and  the  United Federation  of  Planets must defend
itself against  the  ferocious attacks  by  the  Klingon Empire.   The
Federation Council has declared war  in response to the Klingon decla-
ration,  and the President  has  called upon Starfleet  to  defend the
borders of the Federation from the Imperial Klingon Navy. The Rihannsu
Stelam Empire,  watching from the sidelines, quietly reaps the rewards
of  having two  of  its enemies attempt  to defeat one another, whilst
also using the war as a means to their own ends. 
 
In a battle for the future, which side will win?

and magicians.

Its language is English though many players and wizards are
from Germany and speak German.

For people who do not want to become wizards when they
have reached the final level, a Peerage system exists
which allows to take a leading role in a clan comprised
of players, or they can stay normal players.

in under twenty lines.  65 areas in total, all of which have been carefully
checked for interesting content rather than sheer size.

PK is restricted to members of clans who have voted to be involved in
player-killing.  Player stealing is regulated in the same way.

Turf began as a Merc 2.2 in 1994 and has had an evolving code base
since, with a bent on stability as well as features.  In addition to the flashy
features found on all quality MUDs Turf adds stability, averaging under four
crashes in a year.  Turf is rebooted approximately once a month for code

 You have just stepped into a World of Darkness.  Here werebeasts are more
than tales for children and the undead haunt more than just your nightmares.
It is the Lord's Year 1246 and strife is afoot in Iberia.  Men squabble over
the cities of Cordoba and Seville, and outright war is coming closer by the
night.  History is being written, and now you are part of it.  You are part
of a much different history however, a history unknown to all but the most
eldritch mortals and ancient creatures of the night.  The battles between
the Christians and the Moors seem inconsequential when compared to the war
the is fought in the darkness.  The Brujah struggle in vain against the
Lasombra for control of Cordoba, while the Assimites prepare to defend the
streets of Seville against the combined forces of the High Clans.  To
complicate matters the werecreatures known as Garou are also staking their
claim to the area, hoping to prevent the corruption of the vast Iberian
wilderness.  Also of concern is the Inquisition, which is now afoot in
Cordoba and will no doubt soon spread to Seville.  History is being written
by the moment...  Is the pen in your hand, or are you reading the book?  

The Twilight Reconquista is based in the Kingdom of Castile, the area
that is currently Spain.  The game system in use is WhiteWolf's Dark Ages, 
which is used with permission.  We hope to bring you the closest
experience to tabletop gaming possible via a text based game.  This game 
contains no hard coded combat, no monster bashing, no find this/bring it
there questing, only true to table top RP gaming.

We currently have coded support for Dark Ages: Vampire, Dark Ages: Inquisitor 
and Dark Ages: Werewolf.

WWW         : http://www.tigerden.com/~twilight/
Description :

   Twilight is a roleplay-intensive environment, whose pivotal
element is that of the myths and legends of creatures and
beings hidden from the human world but very much part of
it. Players should either make their characters into beings
that can appear as human, or at least as a normal animal
(such as a domestic dog or a sewer rat) in public, and
have a true nature somewhat more paranormal (ie: Vampire,
Werewolf, Mage, Faerie, etc.). Alternately, players can
also play true humans, who may or may not have some kind of
education in this strange world going on right beneath
their noses. The city is dark, techno-gothic, and should
have plenty of mystery.

To get a better feel for the MUCK, we recommend visiting
Twilight as a guest before you send email for a character.
Innovation and creativity are encouraged in both character
creation and tinyplot development! Players are allowed to
make up their own 'race' to accomodate their needs, so long
as it remains in theme and not overly powerful.

Description :

   Twilight MUD. We have 8 guilds, 14 races, 40 subclasses
and lots of original and exciting areas.  We are constantly 
expanding with many new areas and new subclasses in the 
process of being coded.

Players can own their own houses and pubs. We offer cabals
where a cabal can rise from a Cabal Camp to a Cabal Kingdom
complete with its own currency! And if you get tired of 
mudding, we have games coded in the game itself, like poker,
blackjack! 

Sick of all the hash and slash? We are currently 
implementing an extensive crafts system. Fancy some fishing? 
You can either buy a fishing rod or you can made one 
yourself. Dig for some worms as bait, find a nice spot, and 
spend your day waiting for the fishes to bite. Want to grow 
your own crops? Just buy some seeds, look for an empty farm, 
throw down your weapons and become a farmer instead.

Every 2 1/2 hours players get to vote for war.  The wizards 
are a friendly and cheerful lot and are always available
to answer any questions. We have MUD gatherings once in a 
while where players and wizards gather to eat, drink and 
talk about mud. So feel free to drop by our mud and have 
a look.

WWW         : http://kaerlath.genesismuds.com
Description :

 Shades of the Past is a mud that is based upon the White
Wolf World of Darkness RPG system and we use the Dark
Ages books as our guidelines.  Our setting is Venice, Italy,
in the year 1230 A.D.

 We allow Vampire, Bete, Garou, and Mage characters
currently for our players.  More classes are being considered
in the future, with a possibility of perhaps Changeling and
Wraith.

 Our code is totally driven like a tabletop game, with
rolls being 90% dependant upon a Storyteller being involved
in a scene or chronicle.  Combat is not driven by mobs, nor
equipment, but by storyline and RP.  Each turn is rolled out
exactly by the rules as set forth by White Wolf Studios.

 We are a sister mud to Amaranth, but our code is significantly
different, being based upon Dystopia and the code redone
and recoded from scratch, as to save both space, size, and
memory requirements.

 More features include a system that is tied in with our web
pages, and help files that are dynamically created by the mud
and published to the web.

 If you're tired of the same Midgaard and want to try RPing,
give us a try!

Description :

   Strife Mud is loosely based on the Forgotten Realms
setting.  Characters are able to advance through 100 mortal 
levels and 20 additional remort levels. Remorts keep their 
old statistics and skills, but gain enhanced powers 
depending on the class.  Role playing is encouraged, but 
not required.   

  Spell casting is based on a memorization system instead 
of the usual mana system.  Classes include: arcanists, 
clerics, rogues, warriors, rangers, paladins, druids, 
bards, vampires, barbarians, and remort classes: monks, 
shield-dancers, blackguards, chosen, crusaders, assassins, 
and arch-mages.  Races include humans, elves, 
dwarves, half-elves, gnomes, illithid, giants, drow, 
halflings, and minotaurs.

  Various forgotten realms deities (from the time of 
Netheril) are available for worship, and determine which 
spells clerics receive.  There is also an arena in 
which players can fight without losing equipment or 
experience.  

  There are clanhalls with clan bank accounts, clan 
channels, healers, and personal guards.

  Strife is in beta at this time, so some features are in
the testing phase... suggestions are always welcome.  Quest
tokens are offered for writing help files.  The immortals
and players are friendly.  Come visit a growing mud with a
lot of potential.

Telnet      : mud.stick.org 9000 [209.83.132.84]
WWW         : http://bb7.betterbox.net/~stick/
Description :

  Stick in the MUD, founded in February 1994, was one of
the first ROM-based MUDs online.  Originally a hangout
for displaced ROM players and University of Toronto
engineering students, it quickly became populated with
new mudders and evolved its own identity.

Stick attracts beginning and experienced mudders who are
looking for a simple, friendly, relatively clean ROM-based
mud to explore.  It retains mudders who enjoy the diversity
and spirit of community that endure year after year -- and
it retains mudders who just... can't... resist... the urge
to log on....

As a game, Stick in the MUD is much like its name.  It
doesn't change quickly.  This is not a 1000-area 80-race
MUD with 100 people on at all times.  The implementors
are a couple of boring ol' computer professionals who
try hard not to take the game, their roles, or themselves
too seriously.  They keep good backups, fix bugs, and
otherwise sit around and socialize like most everyone else.

For the player who prefers to keep running around killing
monsters after reaching immortality, Stick offers a
reincarnation option with expanded race/class selections.

some of this praise:
 * A totally unique channeling system that allows for improvement
   through usage and/or advancement, as well as the ability to
   teach weaves to other players.
 * The ability to take a weapons Mastery as well as teach various
   forms to others.

Description :

Demongate is currently under development. I have a 
custom OLC that takes alot of work off the builder. 
I am currently in need of some skilled builders to 
help out the few that I have. The world is designed 
already, we just have to build it. I will also accept 
suggestions for new areas to include.

Demongate will be a loose mix of ideas from my gaming
experience, including in-depth quests that now show
in a quest journal for you, a diverse combat code 
for enjoyable hack'n'slash, customized skill and 
talent trees so if you don't want to pick a class you
can make your own, and our races include an array of 
different racial abilities too.

The mud is also going to be RP-involved, with 
immortals covertly taking a hand in the plot of 
events and lives of the mortals. Rewards for 
roleplay will be extensive, from renaming your class,
to customing a peice of equipment.

The world will be full of different races, some good, 
some evil. They are pitted against each other, so 
there is plenty of PK to be done.

When this is done, there will be something for everyone.
I hope to see you all there.

responsible for this reality. The tides of war and peace flow throughout the
past, present, and future, carrying the whims of mortals and immortals alike.
The essence of sorcery surrounds all that exists, offering its power to all who
have the strength to wield it. Fantastic creatures inhabit the wilds as the
sentient races build Korongil's nations within their cities. The path the world
will take relies upon the choices of those who struggle within its reality.

Description :

 Ansible is a Role-Playing (non-combat, non-PK) Game set 10
years prior to the events depicted on the battle school
from Orson Scott Card's novel 'Ender's Game'.

 The players take on the roles of students on an
International Fleet space station and interact with each
other and the teachers.  Specially selected children
(chosen for their intelligence and determination) arrive
to the station as 'launchies', the low of the low newbies,
of approximately 6 years in age.

 Eventually, these students are promoted to 'armies' that
compete in battle games set up by the teachers.  Some of
these soldiers will become Toon Leaders.  A few,
Commanders.  By the time of graduation, at about age 14,
each child will have made many friends and a few enemies,
and learned the abilities they need to become skilled
soldiers, strategists, and pilots for the International
Fleet.

 That is, so long as the teachers don't break the young
recruits by pushing them too hard, desperate to discover
the child commander destined to lead Earth to victory
against a deadly alien race, the Formics.

 SoberMUD is a MUD that is based on Warhammer 40k.  For those

is to translate tabletop 40k into a MUD as smoothly as
possible, while still making it fun to play.  Currently, the 
MUD is undergoing heavy changes, and since I spend all of the
time I have coding, I need builders very badly.  So if you're a

and usually yields an average of 50 players connected at
a time. Players are separated into three main classes.

From lowest to highest, they are: mortals, eternals, and
wizards. Mortals are the newbies, eternals are more  
experienced players, and wizards are those who choose  
wizardry instead of becoming an eternal. Wizards cannot
interfere with game play, but are granted more sys
privileges and have the ability to code new areas for the
mud. It's a very structurally organized mud with friendly
people, and any user would enjoy it.

 Vincent's Hollow LPMUD, established on April 28, 1991, is one of the older

Shattered World.
 
 VH, as it is affectionately called by its players and  wizards, was
established with the simple principle of being different, at a time when a lot
of LPMUDs were constructed of the same stock world with a church, a humpedback
bridge, an orcs' cave, and Leo the Lion.  It was one of the first LPMUDs to
install a player-operated guild system, multi-class and skill system, and
advanced magic casting.  VH also focuses on other 'fun' factors other than your 
everyday 'role-playing'.  We have various on-line games you can play with your
fellow adventurers.  We also sponsor real life parties (most of them in Iowa)
where players and wizards from around the country come and join us couple times
a year to have real life fun (usually for Halloween and New Year).

modifications to several different aspects of it.  With a
unique multi-class system as well as a broad array of
race/class combinations combined with a group based
combat/experience system, we have tried to promote all of
what we feel are the best aspects of mudding in general.
We do allow level restricted player killing, but a bounty
system will allow players to take action against each other
where the game will not allow them to.

    We welcome any comments which can be made via a
note to immortal within the mud, or via email
(escape@alcatraz.wolfpaw.net) if that is easier.

We hope you can enjoy playing in the world we are creating,

Mud         : Turnings of the Wheel
Code Base   : [Circlemud]
Telnet      : 68.16.173.101 4842
WWW         : None
Description :

 Turnings of the Wheel offers a new and exciting concept in
Role Playing.  Based on the Wheel of Time series by Robert 
Jordan, the mud is set a few years after the Fall of 
Malkier.  We offer full Rp experience here so it is 
possible to level your character without ever having to kill
a mob.  Skills can be practiced and learned all with 
roleplay as well.  A unique skill ranking system makes
it so that no two characters are the same, and allows for
individuality to be focused on.  A complete advantage and 
disadvantage further helps character development.  Creation 
can be a bit tricky, but take your time and read the
directions and it will be well worth the effort.  All Wheel
of Time clans and guilds are offered as well as sguilds and
noble houses.  If enough players are gathered Admin will
also consider customized guilds to suit Rp purposes.  The
staff is experienced and dedicated and has a non-
intervention policy regarding roleplay.  There is no
scripted RP here.  

 If you are a fan of the Wheel of Time series and enjoy
roleplay, then this is the place for you.  If your a Rp
fanatic and wish to immerse yourself in a total IC (in-
character) enviroment, you are more than welcome to give us
a try.  All in all, everyone is welcome.

continent including big name areas such as Icewind Dale, Waterdeep,
Candlekeep, Shadowdale and Myth Drannor.  Currently the continent
features the land from Icewind Dale to Myth Drannor.

  Waterdeep also has had extensive code work, both in the creation
of new code and repairs to the Rot codebase.  We feature various
systems such as Ownable Airships, Editable Property, Automated Quests,
Banking, An Automated Arena with Mass Arena, and numberous things we
cannot even remember doing.

  Our goal is to provide a relaxing online gaming enviroment, as much
as possible with any mud.  Our atmosphere is light hearted and filled
with things not for young eyes.  Those offended by sex, violence and

Open since 1993, WoTMUD IV, The Wheel of Time MUD is the most popular MUD 
based on the 'Wheel of Time' novels by Robert Jordan. 100% unique, you'll 
find no stock zones, mobs or features anywhere here. Our game philosophy 
is to leave the choice of the type of game that you wish to play up to you: 
we're a good old-fashioned mud with as few rules as is reasonably possible. 

o For pkillers, The Wheel of Time MUD is set amidst a three-way race war, 
  each race having its own defined 'homeland' and boundary. 
o For the explorer, The Wheel of Time MUD has more than 220 zones each 
  checked for accuracy against the books. No stock here at all.
o For roleplayers, The Wheel of Time MUD's 50 clans includes almost every 
  faction that you would expect to find in the books.
o For socialisers, The Wheel of Time MUD is a large, busy & talkative mud, 
  which peaks at more than 200 people connected!
o For adventurers, The Wheel of Time MUD has different, topical quests 
  for every clan with large global quests determining the fate of the world. 

WoTMUD IV was chosen as the Mud Connector's 'Mud of the Month' in June 1999. 
In the words of online critics, we are 'The Bee's Knees' (games.com, 1997), 
'The Internet at it's best' (freelaunch.com, 1999), 'A Killer World'

different combinations. So there is a lot to explore.

  The world itself consists of 5 islands totalling 250 000
rooms. The islands are divided into areas which have
different stories and monsters etc. In addition there are
entrances to nearly a 100 areas from the large map.

  Players can do different kind of quests to gain levels
with lesser experience costs. You can choose to kill
monsters by yourself or in parties with your friends,
making the play more fun. Larger monsters can give good
equipment which can be worn to give different benefits in
form of boosted statistics and special abilities. The
equipment you make is saved for you to use or sell later
on. If you get rich you can build your own castle, buy a
horse to ride with or buy other things to show off with
your status ;)

  Playerkilling is not encouraged, since too much killing
will make you an outlaw - which are free prey to all!

  We also offer clan system where you can fight other clans
with parties. The good clans get bonuses for their success
in the clan wars.

  We are always ready to hear players' ideas and try to
make the best ones come true. Hope to see you online, come

Description :

 Many years ago, a group of researchers at Miskatonic University sought to
harness the power of reality itself by delving more deeply into the atomic
structure than science had theretofore studied. Frustrated with the
limitations of normal equipment and methodoligies, the scientists borrowed
arcane occult techniques as well as highly unstable theoretical concepts
of physics, many of which had never been tested. The preparations for the
experiment were expeciently and concisely readied for the conjunction of
the planets of classic astrology -- Earth, Moon, Sun, Mars, Venus, Saturn,
and Jupiter. the test proceeded excedingly well initially; however as the
scientists probed further and further into the atoms' cores immense
quantities of energy accumulated well outside the expected range. The
resulting explosion destroyed the laboratory ... but what's more is that
it sent ryfts throughout the fabric of reality through which past, present,
and future collided -- and fantasy and fact became one in the same. Many
claim this is the 'Hell on Earth' foretold in Holy Scriptures -- those
responsible have never been heard from again, though some speculate that
they attained the power they sought to control. The city of Arkham itself
was spared in this merging of realms and has since become the only known
sanctuary left in a world changing constantly as the threads holding
reality together unravel more and more each day.

Description :

Iindor u Taruiithron is a MUD based on the Dawn of Time codebase.
We are in the process of heavily modifying the code to add in
original code of our own as well as original areas. All of the
stock areas and some of the DoT commands have been removed, as
well as new ones installed. We are currently hiring builders to
assist us in this huge project. The ability to work well with
others is a definite plus, however, if builders want to hide in
their hole and not talk to anyone while they're building, that's
their perrogative. A firm knowledge of OLC is preferred, but not
necessary. (As much as we would like to teach, we just don't
always have the time). A minimum of 300 vnums per area has been
set. We will not be accepting areas smaller than this. All
builders will be given an immortal position and must be willing
to work regardless of the fact that there is no playerbase yet.
Because of the lack of original areas, we will not be opening the
MUD to players until we feel it is ready for the world. There is
no book or movie theme. The reason for this is so that it leaves
a lot open to the imagination for the builders, instead of restricting
it so 'this' or 'that' can't be put in.

We are wanting to make this place as original as possible, so keep
that in mind, please.

If you have any questions at all, please feel free to click on the
email link to contact us.

Description :

The Fantasy LPMud called Barsawia is based on Arkadias' CD 
( Genesis - based ) Gamedriver and mublib, which was then highly 
modified by us to meet the needs of players and also to improve game
realistic. 
In order to give players more and more possibilities to improve the
fun of the game, we have added many things, like armour layers, magic,
bows, crossbows, javelins, steal and horse system, and many others.

The team system has also been highly optimized recently. 
Roleplay is highly encouraged here.

The two Domains of Barsawia are based on Earthdawn and Tolkien's
Middle Earth. Currently the game is fully operational and opened
for players to test.

             ***  Warning: Adult Content  ***

 This is a open minded 'yiffy' talker. There is not yet a 
very adequate fighting system though I am looking for a
coder who might be willing to help with such. This chat
is for herps (dragons and reptiles), furries, zoos, plush,
and related fandoms. If you do not know what any of these
mean, then you will most likely not like it there. In 
addition, the large portion of our user base is bisexual.
The talker is not overcrowded, and is mainly for talking to
friends in the same groups as you and yiffing in private or
public, and there are relatively few rules besides 'no 
humans allowed' and don't intentionally piss anyone off.
Note: All commands start with a . (thus who would be .who 
instead)  If you use Zmud, you must change the setting of
movement characters so that it will allow you to put a dot
before commands.

WWW         : http://www.geocities.com/xmythologies/
Description :

 X-Men Mythologies is an X-Men/Marvel Comics themed game centered around 
the fabled students of Professor Charles Xavier. Unlike most other X-MU*'s 
(as they are so fondly called), X-Men Mythologies has five total playable
'worlds' in which to choose from once you've applied for a character. 
The cutoff date for the Mainstream world is about the time of 'Legion Quest'
(And the Age of Apocalypse). Non X-Men characters *are* permitted, as long 
as they are from a Marvel Comic. As well Non Feature/Orginal characters
are welcome, but must be Earth-based and not cosmic powered Mutants. 

The other four worlds outside of the Mainstream world are: 
Days of Future Past - A dark future where mutants are
hunted and killed or placed into concentration camps by
the massive Sentinel robots that dominate America.

The Age of Apocalypse - The High Lord Apocalypse rules
America in this alternate reality and mutants reign 
supreme through his 'survival of the fittest' dogma.

Medieval Utopia - A completely original and invented 
medieval fantasy setting. 

Millennium - Somewhat like a 'Year One' theme (for you DC
fans), the Millennium world is not unlike the X-Men 
Evolution cartoon. Note, however, that it is *not* an 
X-Men: Evolutions world. Closer to the short run/limited 
Children of the Atom comic.

   Xyllomer exists since 1991 and is run by a Club on an own dedicated

It offers a huge complex world in a fantasy setting, where roleplay
is strongly emphasized. We don't have any global channels or shouts, 
but a wide variety of guilds, player-owned houses and ships, and it 
is entirely up to you if you partake in the constant struggle of the 
'good' vs. the 'dark' side, thus risking your life in the hope your
god may protect you - or if you prefer to stand aside and dedicate 
your time to music and beer, peacefully study the arcane art of magic 
or train your mind until you are in perfect control of your body.

The world governs itself through the players, which elect judges, 
create the law and live the role. Xyllomer has a very active Wizard 
and Player community that meets frequently for real life parties.

Be a part of this! Join us on Xyllomer.

   Camelot is furry/anthropomorphic based muck and rules are 
few and can be simply defined as 'Do unto others, as you would

The theme is medieval and started as Camelot which is a 
passion of mine, so I built the village Camelot, and while 
trying to come up with a name for the game - it took it on.. 
It doesn't reflect all that's there, we have a number of 
villages growing (Skylands, South Town, North Village, 
Wehnimers Landing and  Castle Roogna), with more promised to 
arrive soon! Its not just a village of Camelot, but a whole world.
 
Building is encouraged and a helping hand of a free home is 
given with every player with automatic building rights, if 
you are new, to mucking then on my www pages there are even 
pages to help you familiarise yourself with your new 
surroundings, and the commands.
 
Future plans include, a battlezone where characters can take part
in real fights, a inter-village economy, magic and as much
realism as you can take!

Description :

  Ashavar's Legacy is a mud that is challenging and realistic while still being
a lot of fun.  Its focus is more on using your brain than pure hack and slash,
player killing, or role-playing.  There are puzzles built into the game and
randomized quests available.  Players can ask most humanoid mobiles questions
about how to find stores, guildmasters, or puzzle hints.

  This mud uses a race-less and class-less system.  The players choices of
stats determines what spells and skills he or she can learn.  Players can
increase their spells or skills by using them, instead of spending practice
sessions.  Players can also learn skills like mining, wood working, and
leather working so that they can forge their own equipment.  They can find
gems to give bonuses to forged items, runes to make their weapons cast
spells during combat, and glyphs to give their shields protection from a spell.

  There are also many client-like features built right into the mud, for
example aliases, autoactions, and some very advanced wimpy commands.  Other
unique features include specialized containers, a dress command that can
calculate the best equipment in your inventory and wear it, and the ability
to study a given room, then teleport to it later.  We also offer a free client
on our web page.

is the Guild openly recruiting candidates. This also means 
that Full Disclosure is still necessary, as the Ballybran 
symbiont is still a closely guarded Guild secret. People

Description :


Since 1994, ZombieMUD has been on-line and bringing orc-butchering
fun to the masses from our home base in Oulu, Finland. We're a pretty
friendly bunch, with well over 100 players at any given time logging
in from all over the globe to test their skill in our medieval 
role-playing environment.

Like freedom? With fifteen guilds and thrice a dozen races to choose
from, you can play any sort of character you wish. Should you become
tired of one class, then have no fear, simply take a near painless
reincarnation and start your life with us anew without losing all
your precious experience gained in the past. Your choices are near
endless, and you can even play a character as odd as a mage-fighter
if you desire. In the end, we leave it up to you.

Love to collect? On ZombieMUD you are given the opportunity to build
and customize your own personal and permanant castle. Within its 
stone walls you may hoard chest upon chest of goodies, gathered from
througout the realm. You may even amass your own standing army to
defend your castle from wiley intruders.

Want quests? We've got them. Well over 200 various quests and
specially designed 'Equipment mobs' stand ready to challenge your
skill in battle with more tricks than Houdini himself. Hate quests?
That's fine too, as while doing quests will lessen level costs,
they are absolutely not required for advancement within the game.

Enjoy interaction? On ZombieMUD we love to party. Fightin' and
Killin' being specialties of ours most enjoyed in mass. While
fighting solo is a staple of some player's diets, others enjoy the
thrill of the group hunt. During a party you team your skills with
the skills of other guilds to bring down foes of legendary size and
strength. Whether you're a soloer or one who loves to interact, you
will find your niche here.

Admire progress? ZombieMUD has been continuously growing and changing
for over a decade, and it shows. Our lands are vast and our treasures
varied. Our staff is active and attentive to the mud itself,
constantly adding new areas, or improving the old to be certain
that Zombie and its players always have something new to discover.

Dare to begin? Check out our webpages and read up on the information 
listed there for new players. Join us at zombiemud.org, and see for 
yourself what all the fuss is really about.

wonder why you do not see any other empires using 'who', thats because you only see your own empire. As for ships, they have phasers, photons, shields, relicators and even a working EMH to heal awayteams. You move in space until
 you find a planet and assemble away teams (if you are in charge) and beamdown. We at ST Elite, have one wish, to provide the best Star Trek experience for you

Description :

  Deep in space, there is a lush, verdant world filled with as many dangers 
as beauties. The planet Darkon is a world in which elves and humans are 
just becoming aware of each other, in which Mages flirt with elemental 
magic, in which clashing cultures are constantly struggling to gain a sense 
of harmony with one another. Above all else though, its people, no matter 
how rich or poor, fear one thing: A deadly menace that threatens to wipe 
out all who stand in its path. However, to come to Darkon's aid in these 
fearful times are the Dragons and Griffins of the Eyries. When the world is 
threatened, it is they who rise into the air with their riders on their 
backs to combat this deadly foe. Indeed, there are many wonders on Darkon, 
if one is brave enough to step outside.

Recently, the Topaz bond of the Trassa at Twilight Dawn Eyrie has risen in 
flight, and she has been claimed once again by D'arvan's Garnet Savayen, 
ensuring his rider's position as Tarvo. Now, the queen grows heavy with 
eggs, and will very soon leave a clutch on Twilight Dawn's sands! With this 
in mind, the Eyrie scrambles to make ready for the Candidates, and the new 
additions to the griffin ranks, that will soon grace the Eyrie.

So, this leaves a few questions for you. For starters, what kind of a 
person will you be? A haughty noble perhaps? Or maybe you'll have been born 
an outcast in one of the nomadic gypsy clans. Maybe you'll have been born 
in one of the Eyries, and wait hopefully for one of the griffins to sniff 
you out for candidacy. Does leadership suit you? If it does, maybe you're 
the leader of one of the many Guilds. Anything is possible on Darkon. 
Currently, it is looking for all types of players, including good riders 
for Louna's clutch! There might even be a Topaz on the sands this time, but 
apparently Louna's not telling.

So there you have it. Right now, there's tons of opportunities to play any 
kind of character you want! There is even a new area about to open, in 
which you can play one of the mysterious Elves of Galendell.

WWW         : http://starshiptraders.com/
Description :

  Starship Traders is a multiuser strategy game playable either using
a telnet client or a web browser.  It is extremely structured with formal 
rankings of players available at all times.  Games run for a specific 
period and players who complete a game ranked in the top 10% are 
promoted to a higher-level game, populated by others who also did 
well in a previous game.  Unfortunately, everyone at SST has to suffer 
the indignities of playing at least one newbie game before being 
eligible for a promotion. 

Players can create formal alliances to which other players can apply.  
A separate ranking shows the relative cumulative strength of each 
team, though no promotions are based on team results.  

There is a strong military and economic structure to the game, but 
clever politicians  will often prevail over even the best military and 
economic strategists.

If you like a well defined game environment, give SST a look.  It was 
coded completely from scratch in C over a period of 4.5 years.  it's 
design is older still  and has been evolving for 14 years.  It is unlike 
(very unlike!) anything else on the 'net. You'll probably either love it 
or hate it.

Description :

 House of Ghouls is a fun, fantasy-style MUD.  Many of the features
come from the ideas of the players...not all of the ideas get used,
but we are open to hearing your suggestions.  We like to think we are
fairly reasonable, and quite friendly MUD.  It may have a strange
name, but don't let that stop you from at least giving us a try!

Why should you try House of Ghouls over other MUD's?  Here's why!

- Heavily modified Smaug codebase.
- All new experience system.
- All new combat system.
- Be a ghoul, minotaur, goblin or one of the many other races!
- True dual-class character option.
- Tiered classes for the single class adventurers.  Show the Realm
you are the master of your class by becoming a Champion, 
Bishop, Rogue, or Archmagi!
- Automated Questing, with special equipment as rewards!
- Random item creation...find something new each time!  'Randoms' are
usually better than 'stock' items, so everyone isn't wearing the same
set of equipment.  Even find random artifacts, extremely powerful
pieces of equipment.
- Reworked classes...new skills, new spells, and at new levels!
- Completely original areas (except for the mudschool).
- Player-Killing accepted...and an exciting penalty for illegal
player kills (;  
- Friendly players and immortals.  Players have the option of
becoming Demi-Gods after reaching Avatarhood, and other players can
worship them.
- From the mind of Drazuk, veteran of such MUDs as Realm of Shadows 
and The Final Challenge (look them both up, great MUDs!)

and...

- The only MUD I've ever seen where you can go surfing for the
perfect wave!  (It's fun, trust me)

Come give HoG a try!

This new Weyrmount is the virtual home of members of the Ultima Dragons-
Internet Chapter. It is modeled after the ideal world of a host of
turmoil-sick dragons -- intelligent dragons, with the knowledge and power
to build beautiful cities in the mountains and wonderous tools and works
of art.  Most Dragons hold close kinship with the mystical land of
Britannia (the land in the majority of Origin's Ultima series) but, as the
concept is of dragons who have fled terrible catastrophy on Britannia
through a magical portal, this new land is -not- Britannia. Perhaps it is
one of the other lost continents of that world; perhaps it is an entirely
new world altogether. There are still two moons in the sky (Trammel and
Felucca, by observation) and much of the wildlife is the same, but there
the similarities end. The Dragons are all pioneers here, out to explore
and tame this fabulous new world, and make it their new home.

The original Lovecraftian horror mud is back in operation,

new and old imms. All old players are welcome to return, 
and new ones more than welcome.

Cthulhumud is set sometime in the 1920's, with an 
additional fantasy Dreamlands area. In a setting where the 
elder gods reign from afar, foreign invaders lurk around 
the corner, and your sanity is threatened at every turn, 
Cthulhumud builders do their best to remain faithful to the 
works they read (or claim they do at least).

We are currently small in population, but are looking to bring old 
players back and regain our previous size. We are still using
the heavily modified DIKU mud (Driver: Cthulhumud v9.x),
however a brand new C/SQL driven code base is nearing
completion.  Come by and visit the Mud and our website to
keep up with the new developments.  Even under normal
circumstances we do not have a static world- this is a 
place that keeps you on you toes from the first day and
for years to come.  We have a little over 8000 rooms right now
with over 7000 new rooms in the works.  Each room is done
individually by the Immortal staff; none of it is computer
generated.

Between the Euphrates and the Tigris river, in this portion of the world known
as the craddle of humanity, there is a legend rumored at night when children
are asleep. It tells the tale of the ever elusive City of Akashat, nestled in
its lost Vale between high mountains. The city moves, floating from one end of
the desert to the other, never twice at the same place. Dreams are the only way
to access the city and one can find onself trapped forever. Soon, those trapped
organized a system of government, three classes, the Masters, who ruled, the
Citizen, who usually run businesses, and the slaves, used and abused, cared and
pampered by the other two classes. One trapped dreamer, who had the most
powerful dreams, found out how to send other dreamers back, to invade people in
the outside world's dreams and harvest whatever they could find in these, be it
riches, goods or souls. The Grand Vizir now rules over Akashat, aided by a
Conclave of Princes, and opposed by a dark dreamer: The Crimson Cardinal.
Come dream with us in the elusive city, where all dreams are welcome.

and the heroes that wore them. A great sword with incomprehensible 
power to slay gods as if they were a lowly peasant, and the 
forgotten warlord for whom the sword served

 Twilights Dawning is a SMAUG based mud with a several major 
adjustments.  For example, we have new weapon profenciences, multi-
classing, prestige classes (similar to remort or tier system), 
automated quests, and housing code (You can buy and stock your own 
house). These modifications just scratch the surface.  We also have 
a lot of minor fixes and changes that just change the feel of the 
mud. Our areas are all original, and so is our story line.  We also 
have added new races and classes in adition to the regular smaug 
based ones.  This comes out to a total of 8 prestige classes... 13 
normal classes... and 21 races and 5 templates that can be added 
after creation. We also have detailed character development, and 
heavilly encourage role-playing. Twilights Dawning is newbie 
friendly and our immortals will help with any reasonable requests.  

So enter, and experience the chaos that is Twilight's Dawning.

globe, and whatever they collectively form comes to define the
world as we know it. So, too, with MOOsaico.

  What is important in MOOsaico is not what you build, but that
you take a sense of pride in it and that you work to integrate it
well with its local surroundings in order to create a MOO world
that all can explore and learn from.

WWW         : None
Description :

After decades of war, the citizens of Earth have finally 
emerged victorious against the Gou'ld. The war, despite 
massive amounts of bloodshed and overall violence, had 
one beneficial side effect. The general population of
 Earth have become aware of the existance of extraterrestrial 
life and of the stargate itself, confirming the beliefs of 
many while at the same time arousing certain suspicions. 
Conspiracies and hoaxes have ensued in smaller cities and 
groups. The overall reaction, however, is a positive one.

This revelation sparked the curiousity of many. Through 
deep-space analysis of data gathered on an offworld outpost, 
specialists on Earth have discovered another gate system. 
Further study revealed that the system resides in a galaxy 
so far away that the people of Earth would have no way to 
generate the power necessary to travel there by any terrestrial 
means. Not even the stargate could muster enough energy to 
make the massive jump.

The power source needed to reach the other galaxy required 
vast amounts of resources to construct, and the resources 
available were limited. It was therefore determined that 
the best course of action would be to send a colony to one 
of the planets in this gate system, so that they could study 
it without the un-necessary exhaustion of valuable resources. 
Several teams were assembled and supplied, and a colonization 
plan drafted. The teams were sent through the gate [at strategic
intervals RAH], and one by one the power sources ceased to 
function. The colonists were alone on an alien planet...

Description :

 There exists in the Pacific Ocean many myths regarding the
Hawaiian Islands. Some tell the tales of Hawaii's creation as
a result of ancient eruptions of underwater volcanoes. Less
imaginative people try to claim the Islands are nothing more
than small pieces of land that broke off when North America
broke away from Asia. We prefer the old Hawaiian belief that
the islands are nothing less than the fires of Pele herself. The
world is not yet finished. Even now she is being tempered in
elemental flame.
 
A Memoir of Betrayal is a new World of Darkness MUSH set
in Oahu, Hawaii. It is a place of stark contradictions. A modern
city set on the edge of near a tropical paradise. There is beauty
and there is death. Our geographic location provides ample
reason for the Kindred to be in residence. A natural disaster
releases the darkness of the streets to make them perfect for
stalking unknowing among the countless thousands. Mysterious
magical beings favor Oahu because of both its surrounding
lands and the remoteness from the larger over populated lands.
These and more move hidden among the cities of Oahu. And let
us not forget the greatest beast of all... mankind on the whole.
 
We at A Memoir of Betrayal are looking for mature Roleplayers,
who understand the epic journey of the hero. We want those that
understand the true horror of existing as an undead. Come and
begin your journey of personal horror. Come join us in a World
of Darkness.

WWW         : None
Description :

  Set only a few years following the Patternfall War,
Patternfall MUSH is designed as a game of politics, plots, and
intrigue. Amber and Chaos are both on the road to recovery
following the war's end, and that road is filled with dips and
bumps of all sorts. 

  In recent years (or turnings, in Chaos), Swayvill has reached
his end as ruler of the Courts of Chaos. Since then, there has
been even less stability in the realm than usual. Likewise,
Random has abdicated his rule in Amber, leaving the realm of
Order seeking even footing as a number of regents take the reigns
and are replaced. Corwin has departed again, as have a good
many of the Amberite elders, seeking their own goals in
undisclosed locations by and large. The children of the Elders
move more visibly throughout both realms, taking the more active
roles left vacant by their parents.

  In all, the realms remain much as they always have, though
interaction between them has grown much improved from where it
began.
 
  [[Patternfall MUSH is a game based on Roger Zelazny's series
of Amber novels, focusing most heavily on the first five and (at
times) utterly ignoring the latter. Features (i.e. characters
seen in the novels) are available for play via application to the
wizard staff, and kidbit characters can be acquired with the
permission of the desired parent (or the wizards). For more
information on MUSH policies and character availablilities,
please look through our news files on the game.]]

explore the higher mysteries of Astral Space and beyond.

WWW         : http://www.raddrpg.com/hd/
Description :

     Welcome to Heroes' Dreams!  HD is a Multi-User eXperience
(MUX) dedicated to super hero genre role-playing, with a unique
continuity that marries the DC and Marvel worlds together from
each universe's very inception.  There is no 'magic portal' or
'temporal anomaly' here that just flings everyone into one place
at random, nor is this a primarily DC or Marvel MUX which simply
allows characters from the 'other set' to be apped as AFCs or 
secondary characters.  

     Our vision is a MUX where the two are truly melded in 
symbiosis.  Over the years, many super hero MU*s have come
and gone.  Most of them  have focused on one particular comic
universe, while others have taken a more 'free and easy' 
approach, letting in almost anything.  Not all have  been to 
these extremes, indeed many shades of gray have existed 
between the two.  However, Heroes' Dreams MUX takes a 
somewhat unique approach.  We have begun with a sort of 
'Year One' continuity that specifically melds DC and Marvel 
together in a way particular to our choosing.

     The specifics of our theme can be found on our web page. 
Characters from other comic universes may be written in on a 
case by case  basis, but the basic idea here is to make the 
MUX really feel like DC and  Marvel had grown up together, 
not to just cram the two into the same space.

there.  Rafermand has been around for 6 years and still 
owned/programmed by the original founder.  You will easily 
find a unique game features player owned kingdoms, level and 
classless systems, a quest system that generates random 
areas, mobiles, and treasures.  In addition to this we offer 
a unique battle system offering over 300 skills/spells to 
make it even more interesting.  Instead of offering 50 races, 
we only have 6 races with each race having their own strength 
and weaknesses making the game a lot more balanced than just 
throwing out every race known to man.

Besides all of this, we have developed a very robust 
wilderness system that allows you to modify just about 
everything on it if you are involved in a kingdom.  We offer 
MXP for those running zmud/mushclient and it is used to help 
the learning curve of our numerious commands and hopefully 
offer some graphical support in the future.  

Now is a good time to come join the fun.  There will be new
additions soon that will help out the new adventurer, new
skills and spells to take combat and progress in different
directions, and a new bazaar like trade system where you 
can purchase other people's wares.  Come check us out and 
see why we have players that have been playing 3-6 years.

Description :

It was a hardy breed that settled the Wild West, a variety of
folks from all walks of life: homesteaders, merchants, cattle
barons, gunslingers -- from the humble to the adventurous.
In a thousand small towns they were scattered, across a land
both harsh and giving, etching out what living they could in
whatever manner they were suited to. Lago township wasn't any
different, really. Perhaps a little wilder, more a place for
the brave of heart, but not much different...

This MUSH is a re-enactment of the Wild West as portrayed in
classic Western movies and popular fiction. The setting fits
into the historical context of the Wild West, but allowances
are made for the heroic role-play and the ability of
characters to create their own legends. It does not strictly
adhere to historical accuracies, except in the broadest sense
(i.e. Don't think about taking over the U.S or starting your
own Civil War).

For character ideas, and to get a better idea of the kind of
feel we're looking to create in the game, we recommend the
following movies: Quick and the Dead, For a Few Dollars More,
High Plains Drifter, Tombstone, Pale Rider, Magnificent Seven,
Wild Bunch, Rio Lobo, Big Jake, The Shootist, The Cheyenne
Social Club, Silverado, Paint Your Wagon and The Oxbow Incident.
Also, check out the Deadlands RP game and the Jonah Hex Series,
since anything is possible on Ft. Bloodshed...

One that never fights for his/her clan's cause?

Ever dreamed of decapitating them and resuming reign?
We hope you will, and take great pleasure in doing so.

Though open for play, some final glitches etc are being ironed out.

We hope you will come check us out, and bear with us.

  Mosswood Forest MUSH! - Newly opened and being fitted up

interested in being future players, those who wish to lend a
helping hand, or players of the former Mosswood Forest MUCK.

  The world was created, fresh and new and empty, a playground
for the gods. The gods created a portion of this paradise world
to be different from any that had come before, giving it a cool
climate, harsh mountainous terrain, deep softwood forests, and
huge plains of ice. With time, mortals set to live in this world
came to call this area the Mosswoods, and many strange and
wondrous creatures were created to live within it borders. It was
a sort of utopia where all were accepted, no one race having
dominance above the rest. The gods, however, found themsevles
divided over the ruling of the land, rarely agreeing with the
other, and thus fighting broke out between them, dividing the
gods into two seperate Pantheons.

  Though there had been others areas of the world more beautiful
and more powerful, none were as wondrous as the Mosswoods or its
caretaker, Palda, the goddess of beauty. Truly original things
were rare in the long lives of the gods and all grew to secretly
covet the Mosswoods and their caretaker despite their particular
affiliation with one pantheon or the other. In time, a great war
broke out over this stiatuion, and, thus, the arrangement was
shattered, the land broken, the peace and utopia of the Mosswoods
scattered to the four winds. Lesser beings of the Mosswoods fled
before the combat of the gods, seeking to survive however they
could.

struggle for Balance between Chaos and Order, or just nail people to
burning crosses... There is room for any type of storyline you wish
to write.

We have several basic classes: Ninja, Fighter, Knight, Mage (with
perhaps more on the way), as well as prestige classes like: Dancer,
Dragoon, Monk, Samurai, Summoner that you can apply for if your rp
warrants it. We pride ourselves on the uniqueness of things we have
come up with. If your race that you want to rp is not one of the
races we have availible for creation, ask an immortal to change your
ICrace and we can let you show up on the wholist as anything up to 9
characters in length. We also have customizable equipment slots and
strings, letting you choose what you call the places you wear your
equipment or even what order they are in if you wish. Our areas are
all original (though you may recognize some of them from Final
Fantasy or such). We have a world map that connects one area to
another instead of your normal 'nnnneeeesssswwww' direction to
another area its more like, 'Well you go kinda north east from
Figaro, I'm sure you wont miss it.' We try and use progs to keep our
city mobs up to date on gossip and world events, as well as filled
with in area quests for you to solve for better equipment and items.

Mud         : Frandum
Code Base   : [DUM] Fairly rewritten/extended DUMII
Telnet      : frandum.enst.fr 2001 [137.194.168.89]
WWW         : http://www.enst.fr/~frandum/
Description :

What you need to do:
- quest!
- explore, discover the world history (learn)
- use and combine items to solve puzzles (think)
- talk to mobiles and (only) sometimes fight them (interact)
- roleplay, talk with our friendly Wizards and admins (live)

What will help you do it:
- almost unique code-base (only 2 other MUDs share it)
- very friendly parser supporting an extensive command list
- extensive spell list (and much more than just: hurt, hurt more, hurt deadly)
- original skill system (yes, there is more to skills than percentages and fighting)
- PK limited to Wizards or a parallel world (the Tournament of Death)

What will make you do it:
- killing is (at last!) not needed to gain experience: only questing is rewarding
- coherent and original fantasy world, consistent background, encompassing world history
- a cosmic balance between the three gods can both change and be changed by every player
- guilds scattered throughout the world: quest to gain power and influence (Wizards can also choose a class)
- a unique language system, based on your race (hey, what did this elf just say?)

WWW         : http://wallowing.whatever.net.au/
Description :

Wallowing MUD is quite an old MUD that never really had a lot of players.
It's still there for two reasons:
 
1) So the owner (Stormdragon) can write LPC as a hobby.
2) So old players/wizards can drop by and say hello.
 
The mudlib is sort of based on LPC 2.4.5 with a rather lot of
modifications.  (Want to drop by and say hello to Leo?  He's still there)
 
There are some fairly interesting things in the mudlib, for
example, programmable npcs(stack based programming language, oddly
enough ;]) and map based virtual areas.  There has been a
lot of work done on wizard commands to make them both intelligent and
powerful.
 
So, if you're interested in writing interesting objects/commands, drop by
and say hello.  Hell, if you're interested in playing - you can do that
too. (Hopefully - it's been a while since actual playing was tested)

Description :

Are you afraid of the Dark?

Bourbon and Blood brings you deep into the occult underbelly of present night New Orleans. Undead 
stalk the streets, preying off tourists and natives alike, and holy warriors fight a losing battle 
against the encroaching darkness. Here in the City that Care Forgot, the only thing hotter than the 
nights are the countless intrigues plotted in the steamy darkness.

You should be...  

   Bourbon and Blood is an online World of Darkness chronicle set in modern night New Orleans. The 
game is handled via an online Mu* which can be connected to via telnet. We currently support several 
systems, including Vampire: The Masquerade, Werewolf: The Apocalypse, Ghoul: Fatal Addiction, as well 
as our own Infernalist system. Vampire hunters in our chronicle go by the rules set forth in Dark Ages: 
Inquisitor. We allow normal hunters by special request only. We feel that the Inquisitor system better 
mirrors the real New Orleans environment.

   Any questions or comments can be posted up on the forums via the website. We're always looking 
for new players, and we're happy to help with any questions or problems you may have.

Welcome to Dragonball: PoWeRuP sMaSh!!!

We've only just created a day ago, but already we are looking for builders (I 
am willing to teach those who don't know how to build) and coders. There is NO 
head builder. I am the head builder as well as the implementor, at least for now.

Thing's We've got that lots of muds don't:
 - Fusion
 - Super Saiyan 5
 - SBFS (skill based fighting system) instead of just typing kill <thing> you 
have to use an attack such as knee or kamehameha. And even then you have to keep 
typing attacks. most ki attacks must be charged and released to use.
 - A friendly staff
 - A more than cool implementor (ME!)
 - Most positions are open

Thing's we've got planned:
 - A whole new world above the ground for when ur flying
 - Ability to destroy objects and even planets with ki beams and blasts
 - And much more!

So come onto the mud today!

WWW         : http://www.dbsaga.com
Description :

  Dragonball Saga MUD is dedicated to providing its players with
a fun environment to fulfill their dreams of becoming part of the
Dragonball universe. Begin by picking one of seven races easily
recognizable from the Dragonball shows : Humans (Yamcha,
Krillin), Saiyans (Goku, Vegeta), Halfbreeds (Gohan, Trunks),
Nameks (Piccolo, Lord Slug), Icers (Frieza, Cooler), Androids
(Android 16, 17, 18, etc.), and Bio-Androids (Cell). As you
fight, you increase your powerlevel (PL), and become a more
fearsome fighter. At certain levels, you will gain special
attacks like the Kamehameha wave, Special Beam Cannon, and Death
Ball! You can train in higher gravity levels to increase your
stats, or spar another player to gain far more PL than you would
randomly fighting the creatures you encounter.

  The MUD is filled with areas and characters from Dragonball.
Roshi's Island, Namek, and the Big Gete Star are all here! A new
Afterlife feature has recently been added, as well. Adventure
throughout the Otherworld, visit King Kai, and fight against the
inhabitants of HFIL. There is NO LIMIT to your powerlevel, so the
game is never really over. Player killing is available, along
with a bouny hunting system. There's even a Fusion system being
developed for addition soon...

  So, visit the Dragonball Saga. A large staff of helpful
immortals, players that love the show, interesting areas, and
character choices that will keep you playing well past the first
Super Saiyan level...

Description :

  Ryksyll MOO is a relatively new world.  It is an adult-
restricted game, though not necessarily adult oriented.  
CyberSex is allowed in most semi-public areas, and in most 
public areas as well.  
 
  Character setup is detailed, and done easily through a
webpage, something that most games do not have.  The 
webpage allows you to setup almost all aspects of your 
character, from description and gender, to the clothing 
objects he or she wears.

  We're still looking for builders and coders.  But a MOO 
like Ryksyll is never fully coded.  

  Ryksyll MOO is a strongly themed and Roleplay intensive 
game.  It is based on the world of Mycle which is the 
foundations for some books in progress.  The stories can be 
found at http://ryksyll.com/~durpost/  Characters must be 
requested from the webpage at 
http://moo.ryksyll.com:8889/request/.

* Fantasy Moon *                              
   The defeat of Chaos was no doubt Sailor Moon's finest moment of glory.
 All of the Starseeds have now been implanted in new people, and the 
Soldiers are reawakening. Some places in Tokyo still echo the Silence
from before the time of Galaxia, and speak to those few who are
sensitive enough to hear it. They warn of a dimensional rift ... 

   We are not strictly Canon here at Fantasy Moon. Our Soldiers will
awaken with no prior memories, although there are clues and
possibilities to remember pieces of the past. The head wizard of
Fantasy Moon wants the basic personalities of the Senshi to be
somewhat canon - IE: Mercury is shy (straight), Venus is cheerful
(straight), Mars is dedicated (probably bi), Moon is naive but full
of love and goodness (not necessarily clumsy, but that would be fun
too.) - She belongs with Endymion, Chibi Moon is 'the spore,' -
possibly bisexual, possibly in love with Saturn, Jupiter is strong
but feminine (sexuality up to the player), Saturn is weak bodied
and powerful (probably homosexual, definitely in love with Chibi
Moon), Uranus and Neptune are lesbian lovers who belong together,
Uranus is duty bound and a fighter, Neptune is more lighthearted but
aloof and standoffish, and Pluto is mostly an unknown. The starlights
are cross-dressers, not sex-changers. Beyond this, we are likely to
be non-canon - even wildly so.

Telnet      : mud.blazingdarkness.net 4000 [209.126.160.58]
WWW         : http://www.blazingdarkness.net/
Description :

   The one main thing that we've been striving for on our MUD is a good
amount of realism. We felt that many other MUDs out there were wildly
unrealistic and mechanical in the way the game flows. Hack and slash games
can be fun, but that isn't what we want. Our plan is to make
BlazingDarkness as player driven as possible, and without the random
occurances you see on some games that just don't make any sense. What
you'll find here is a combination of classic old style mudding combined
with with ability to actually interract with other players in a roleplaying
environment. A large amount of the game is hunting in our vast world and
killing your enemies with your normal automated commands and the usage of
spells and skills. That is what makes a MUD a game at all. The new parts of
the game we've added to BlazingDarkness are there to keep you interested,
restore the fun, and you'll want to come back for more. Now involve
yourself with land ownership, a noble hierarchy, clans, the ability to make
things and sell them in your shop, weapon and armor smithing, religion,
advanced spells, and much more. You don't have to just be a mage, cleric,
thief, or warrior. With BlazingDarkness you may find yourself following
several destinies all at once.

Description :

  Nanvaent is not a simple game. It cannot be finished, for it
expands continuously. It cannot be beaten, for its first and last
goal is to provide you, the player, with entertainment. It can be
approached in a myriad ways, and success at it is not reached by
rote or mere button pushing. To become great in Nanvaent, you will
need the talents simpler games do not require - cleverness and
quickness of thought, communicativeness and cunning, perseverance
and passion. We believe Nanvaent is enjoyed best through deep
involvement with others, making friends - and sometimes enemies,
debating and joking, forging alliances and competing with your
fellow travelers in our world. At its most exciting, Nanvaent is
a scene of touching friendships and bitter conflicts - a place of
extremes, of both honour and villainy, and not a sugary, bland
environment of easy progress, pointless experience gathering, or
tedious, impersonal killing.

construction, and are open to any and all suggestions.

  With all the MUDs out there, we feel that RotA can
offer the best to both new and experienced players.
Our immortals and creators are all SMAUG-experienced
administrators, which gives RotA that extra boost
which makes it great. Constructed with both unique and
stock areas, each player is given a wide choice in
exploration. We have a quest council, a creator
council, a newbie council and a major administrative
council...all the more avenues of expression for those
who have suggestions in making RotA better every day.

  So if you're new to playing on SMAUG-based MUDs, or
are experienced and looking for a change of pace, then
we all welcome you to the Realm of the Ancients. We
are newbie friendly and always willing to lend a hand
(or an ear) to those who need the assistance.

Description :

   Arkadia is a Hard Fantasy, roleplaying, Polish-language LPMud. Thanks to
the generosity of Genesis, it runs on CD gamedriver and mudlib, changed and
further developed by us. The main changes have been made to fit the Polish
declension, to hide out-of-character information from the players, and to
make some things more realistic. Thanks to this, Arkadia has a rich, highly
detailed and realistic world, making a perfect roleplaying environment.

   Currently, we have domains based upon Andrzej Sapkowski's Wiedzmin saga
and Warhammers's Old World. Players have six classical fantasy races to
choose from, and some rich-background race and occupational guilds and
clubs to join. All elements of the world are subject to strict coding
standards, which assures them to be detailed and unique, and to follow
their domain's theme.

   All of the above wouldn't weigh a lot without the excellent players we
have. They create most of the magnificent atmosphere and make the world
vivid. If you feel you would like to be part of Arkadia, learn some Polish
and join us! ;)

Description :

The setting of Star Wars K'tor Nebula is during the Rebellion era of
the Star Wars universe.  The Empire is in control of most of the
galaxy, the Republic has been dissolved, and the rebellion is
growing.  The K'tor Nebula is located on the fringes of the Outer
Rim between Ord Mantell and Yaga Minor.  The K'tor Nebula is an
important resource for the Empire, as it contains large amounts of
unprocessed ore, chemicals, and gasses.  The Empire is mainly
concerned with the Nebula, and only holds control of the two star
systems very near it in word, and the occasional visit of forces to
them alone.  The game is set up on a modified D20 system.  The game
is not consent based but players must have In Character
justification to kill another.  There are a lot of faction positions
available, sub faction autonomy is a focus and it is easy for
Independents to get ships. Force Sensitivity is randomly decided in
character generation, and for those players who do not get randomly
selected in character generation, the option becomes available to
buy force senstivity with skill points starting at 10th level. Most
races are available, character generation is set up for the core
rulebook races but requests for other races are acceptable.  Player
Run Plots are encouraged and additional experience is awarded for
conducting them, so roleplay heavy individuals will always have
fruits of their labor.  You get experience for being connected, you
get even more for being in a public roleplay room.  Players can
+Award 500 experience 7 times every two weeks, no questions asked.
And have unlimited staff reviewed experience nominations beyond
that.  There are several coded systems and an informative info,
rules, and +help file library.

  SuperMegaTopia is based on the popular Furry-style superhero
comics at http://www.supermegatopia.com created by Brian and
Stuart Burke. We put great stress on roleplay, and all characters are
required to speak with a Play Relations staffer regarding either how
to play a well-developed character from the comics, or how to adapt
an original character to fit into the genre more effectively. We keep
our public areas clear of sex-related plots but by no means
discourage relationships, as long as they keep it clean in public.
We also require anyone applying to read the comics that the muck
is based on, as a player would be lost without the plots and
information contained within.

So if you've ever wanted to play a witch, white lighter, demon,

just be the place for you.

We've got a small, friendly player base which is ever growing
and people who are more than willing to help out and RP with new

  Sometimes, it just doesn't pay to get out of bed in the
morning. Just outside your window, the world is on the brink of a
nervous breakdown. There are mutants running around out there,
but anyone you meet could be one. Were your sisters' eyes always
that strange shade of blue? Magic isn't just for scary hermits
anymore, wall street CEOs are buying voodoo dolls by the
truckload. The people breaking into cemeteries on Halloween
aren't innocent teenagers as much as they're hoping to summon
demons. Old evils are awakening, and we're not just talking about
the Elton John summer tour. And Big Brother has been reading your
livejournal. So where do you go from here?

  After some major changes, X-Men: Resurrections has reopened
with a brand new beginning, a return to the +traits system of
old, and nearly every canon character available for application.
We're not only beginning with Year One, we're restarting with Day

together for the first time once the doors open and the RP
commences.

After over 9 years of mudding and about 5 of coding, 
I have found that the best way to produce a mud which 
is entertaining and, all in all, badass, is to allow 
the players to have a big part of the devlopment process. 
So as of now we are open for player testing. However, 
dont let that turn you off to much, it wont be long 
before we are ready to blow up...
   Aside from that, Our Imms are pretty chill, fair people, 
who all have a good amount of experiance in

Description :

Daggerfall Was a mud based on Circlemud 3 BP 11. Very old.
Daggerfall is now a Coffeemud, and being developed along side the
newest Coffeemud, so as soon as soon as new features and security
flaws are implimente in coffeemud, Daggerfall has them. 

Are you ready to play in a fully immersive text based world that will 
eat your shorts? 

Are you ready to start life anew as a charactor in a fantasy world 
where anything is possible?

Do you have plenty of free time to waste?

Stop by Daggerfall! You just might like it!

Variations from stock coffeemud:

Mostly visiual (channels, who, etc)
Hit based experience as opposed to kill based experience. There 
are problems with this system to be worked out.. imbalance, not 
instability.

There are a few other things as well...

For coders that want to help, I've got a big project in mind that 
will dwarf all other mud projects. It's not exactly server related,
more client end. It has something to do with creating a cross 
platform, ultra-fast 3d mud client, without adding ANY overhead
to the server, and making one universal to ALL muds, then admins 
could take it and make a release specific for their mud. I've got 
the ideas,and some of the know-how, and I've got the software to 
do it, just not the time to slap it together alone.  Connect to
Daggerfall for more!

WWW         : http://www.podmud.com/
Description :

  We've planned for Planes of Dominion to be a different mud. This game is 
NOT about pk. We're here for people to role play in a fantasy environment
and to live a life other than their own, not to let people vent stress or
lessen someone else's enjoyment of the game. Player killing IS allowed but
is controlled, and there for role play purposes only. As of now, we have 
40 selectable races planned (includes sub races), as well as many remort
classes to come. There are 6 planes of being, including the prime material
relm (the one used by most players), an underworld, and a heaven like dim-
ension. The other 5 will be populated with remorts who can move freely to
and from dimensions, but for normal mortals, only accessible through very
powerful summoners opening gateways. We have planned a very different way
of doing religion as well as a full zodiac. Roleplay will be personalized
not only for the popular players, but for the normal, everyday player as 
well. We're going to try our best to make everything fair, and let people 
enjoy our mud as much as possible. Area's will be controlled by the assi-
gned immortal and he/she will interact with said player in different ways
making the player's stay on their toes and ready for anything. We're 
going to try and make it as realistic as we can but not so real that it's 
no fun. We're all open to any ideas or suggestions you have. Thank you, 
and enjoy.

Description :

Perched in the silent void of the Dulcais sector sits one of the Federation's
most strategic outposts; Station 419. At the edge of the Klingon and Romulan
borders, 419 keeps a watchful eye on the new Romulan/Federation alliance
against the Dominion aggressors and their Cardassian lapdogs.
 
It is here that the Federation is attempting a grand experiment of peace in
this difficult time of war. With a crew made up of both Starfleet and Romulan 
officers, Station 419 is poised to usher in a new era of peace with the Romulan
people, or destroy the notion once and for all.
   
Anomaly is concentrated on story, theme and character and not simulated space.
We run episodes tabletop style as well as Tiny Plots. If you think you have 
what it takes to make it into the cast, then come by and check us out.
We're very different from other Trek MU*s out there.

Description :

Here is a snippit of our theme. If you'd like more info, 
please check out our website:

  The Elves were a peaceful people, living like Native-
Americans of Earth's history. They dwelled deep in the 
forests, cutting themselves off from the main populace of 
the rest of the planet. The Elves revered the land and did
not approve of stone cities, which represented the 
ultimate distancing from the Grandmother, their revered 
deity. The world around them had become corrupt and despite 
their best efforts, that corruption would have spread to 
the forests and engulfed the Elves. Therefore Grandmother 
warned them that a great asteroid would come that would 
destroy the world. She said she would open a portal to a 
new land, clean and free of sin where the Elves would make 
their new home: Eternity. And so the Elves prepared 
themselves for the journey, gathering with them supplies 
they would need to establish a new camp. Approximately 400 
people walked into the mist-portal and emerged on the other 
side, but there are some still missing. Now that the Elves 
have solidly established themselves on Eternity, other 
people have begun 'arriving' randomly (this can explain 
where your character has been)...and in good time, too, for 
a new race looms on the horizon. It is not known if they 
are friend or foe but time will tell.

an In Character manner.

Players are given a choice of species, classes, starting locations, and encouraged 
to create a minor background of where their characters came from and how they came 
to be in the world of Golden Realms Muck.

The emphasis of the mud is to be a challenging game. Themes includes Tolkien, 
Dragon Lance and many others. The world is strictly medieval fantasy based.

weakling in a world that is quite hostile. It is up to
you to explore very carefully, or find someone stronger

Much resources have been applied to creating some outstanding Online
Building tools that most builders thought would never see reality on
any mud, anywhere. Â These efforts are evident as each new area is
revealed with more and more depth and life, and the challenges and
puzzles are that much more involved.

Organized into Kingdoms, with player controlled nobility that can
use their wealth to increase their holdings, the player communitie
form tight alliances and bonds between players, always competing
with rival Kingdoms to ensure their supremacy. Â Players may also
carve out their own plot of land and earn a castle that they can
maintain and modify themselves with their own personal wealth.

20 classes to choose from, as well as two additional mutli-classes
to add to your base class, as you strategically attempt to create a
character most suited to your style of play.

An extremely helpful and knowlegeable Immortal staff are available,
as they continue in their commitment to bring you an original game
that is ever evolving, creating new challenges and new features for

Mud         : Worlds of Carnage
Code Base   : [Dikumud] Heavily Modified Code
Telnet      : wocmud.org 4000 [66.11.173.122]
WWW         : http://www.wocmud.org
Description :

The Worlds of Carnage is different from many of the other
MUDs you have played. At the outset you can choose from
many of the standard races for most muds, and you can
choose from several places to make your home. Additionally
you can choose to play with a class or without. Within the
world the skills you obtain depend on the skills you have
learnt formerly. Additionally, your primary stats have a
bearing on the quality of your skills, so any race can
learn any skill up to 99%, but depending on the relevant
primary stats the effectiveness may be more or less.

The Worlds of Carnage also runs on a micro gains and micro
ticks system. This means that whenever you kill a creature,
or perform a quest that has an experience reward, you make
rolls for various stat gains at that time and not when you
gain a level. On that note, there are levels in the game,
but your level is dependent on your experience and as such
can go up and down as your experience increases or
decreases. Micro ticks are like normal ticks except rather
than have you receive some kind of regen bonus every 60
seconds or so, the bonus you would have received is broken
into multiple slices and applied over much shorter
intervals.

For the adventurer who likes attention to detail and
variety, the Worlds of Carnage is almost entirely original
with only a couple of small stock areas kept for historical
reasons (and they are heavily modified). With 16 years of
existence much time has passed to create rich and woderful
places to adventure. Additionally, the Worlds of Carnage
recently absorbed the MUD formerly known as Cythera (which
originally split from WoC about 10 years ago). This has
created a diverse system with multiple continents for
adventure.

Finally, for those that like the wierd and wonderful, or
those who might be interested in building areas for WoC, we
have a Web-based world editor which allows changes to be
made from anywhere and reloaded into the game on the fly.
Rooms, mobiles, and objects can take advantage of the
BlobbieScript MUD scripting language to create amazing
affects and behaviours. BlobbieScript is 100% backward
compatible with the old easyacts system upon which even
mobprogs are based. The difference is that BlobbieScript is
a true scripting language and allows for on the fly
variables, running context management, over 200 built in
functions to do almost anything, and the -> operator to
access virtually every data element of rooms, mobiles, and
objects. Additionally, commands, skills, and spells in the
game can be completely written in BlobbieScript allowing
for live update within the game without the need to reboot.

So what are you waiting for, come get started and immerse
yourself in a world full of challenge and entertainment.

 Every game has its types of players.  Some play the hero,
while others the villain.  From the fool, the thief, and
the merchant to the scientist, the mystic, and the noble,
there is always a niche someone fits into.  The MUD 
experience is a theatre of personalities playing out their egos
on the game stage.  Whether a player comes to conquer all
or to setup a tavern, we want it all to be possible at Medieval
Theatre.

 At this time, we are a development site that is about one
year old (started Jan 7 2001).  We are seeking coders
and builders to help make our world, however, because
of a recent influx of new wizards, we would like you to
write a significant letter of purpose that would clarify
your goals as a wizard and the projects you are interested
in.  Try not to be particularly fixated in this letter as
your plans must be flexible enough to fit into the type
of game world that MT is, which of course, you must look
at before making any implementation level decisions.  To
apply, send your e-mail to the listed address.  Our content is not
very extreme, but we should say that this is not a 'family mud.'
If you watch television, however, most of the content should
be suitable for you.

amazing amount of control over their clan and are directly in touch
with their God. The Gods of Dark Mists are actively seen in the game
and their wrath, and blessings, can be felt in all aspects of a
character's life.
 
Our administrators are devoted to the game and friendly to the
playerbase, yet we are firm in maintaining the rule of law. The
playerbase themselves are creative and competitive, and quite
friendly. But be warned, the atmosphere at Dark Mists is vibrant with
roleplay and playerkilling both required to make a successful and
strong character. You will need a strong heart and quick wit to carve
out your legacy in Dark Mists. 
 
The game is always evolving, always changing. There is always
something new and exciting to learn or explore or to see. Come see

Hiya! Well, we're finally open for player testing. :)
We offer, clans, guilds, player-killing, quests, cool
spells and skills, and OODLES of rooms to play in.
We won't weave some fantastic story that you have to follow
if you're into roleplay, we believe that is YOUR choice.
We've decided to try to let the players have as much say as
possible in the selection process of Immortals, but hey,
you have to be there to vote. :)

We've decided to make the mud welcome to all tastes. We've
purposely left the stock zones in so those who prefer those
zones can play in them, but we do have MANY brand new zones
that will suit many tastes. :)

There are just too many things to list, and frankly, we
believe the mud will speak for itself. So just come check
us out, you decide if you want to stay or not and become
part of our family. :)

Description :

   Medieval fantasy mixed with Elves part Tolkien-part ElfQuest, 
add in Firelizards from Pern, and magic of three kinds. Good 
versus Evil? Not really, but there is conflict, controversy, and 
strange happenings in this make believe Celtic style country. 

   The MUX contains Humans, Half-Elves, and Elves with more 
races to come as the game grows. With new races may come new 
magics. Currently we are accepting builders, coders, lesser 
staff positions. Nobles, and non-human races will be application 
only in order to assure players able to move forward RP.

   About 1000 years ago Glathnor was invaded by their southern
neighbors and were not able to defend themselves. The Machaire
family was removed from the throne and killed. All save one. It 
took several more generations but finally it happened just over 
800 years after they lost the throne. The current timeline 
started when King Kylan reclaimed the throne of Glathnor.

  Generations later we come to the present time...

  King Colain died late in the summer of 204 leaving his son,
only 19, to be king. Aidain, Great grandson of Kylan, was crowned
king in the fall of that year. Two weeks later the newly crowned
king was married to the daughter of the Duke of Kentigern.

(The staff of DC: Sterling would like to note here that,
while the MUsh concentrates on the -Silver Age- of DC 
Comics, MUsh events occur current day and pre-established 
comic's canon is not strictly upheld. While a working 
knowledge of the Silver Age of DC comics is helpful, it is 
not totally necessary. We use statless chargen, consent-
based combat. At MUltiverse, we focus on ROLEplay and 
not 'ROLL-play'. Friendly, family environment and attentive 
staffers. We'd also like to note that, at present, while 
there is usually a staffer around at any given time, the 
MUsh is most active at night, 8:00 pm to 4:00 am

WWW         : None
Description :

  He-Mush is a place based on the classic series of He-Man and
She-Ra. You know from way back in the 80s? When your hero always
did something campy or said something cheesy. When women were the
same height as the men. When loveable token comic relief
characters were around and actually used.

  On He-Mush we have 5 primary factions, He-Man with the Heroic
Warriors, Skeletor with the Evil Warriors, She-Ra with the Great
Rebellion, Hordak with the Evil Horde and King Hiss with the
Snake Men. But that’s not all; we also have many characters that
are not aligned to any one specific faction.

  Our theme is a mixture of the classic cartoon series and the
later mini-comics. But we are not limiting ourselves to just
that. Just as the original series dealt with time travel, other
worlds and alternate universes, we will explore these
possibilities too.

  This is a two-planet system Mush with room for growth; we
currently have a small player base but hope to grow in numbers.
As such planet hopping can and will occur. We emphasize on
role-playing at He-Mush, this is not a hack and slash mud even
though we do have a combat system.

  If you love the 80s, fantasy, role-play and have a good
imagination, this is the place for you.

Description :

Cosrin is a well established, roleplaying and adventure MUD in a fantasy setting. Friendly and easy enough to get into, but challenging, with simply huge longevity for all players. 
Now, for the stat-minded, there are some 8000+ locations, with more being coded and tweaked all the time. Over 400 quests, ranging from the elementary, to the truly mind bending. Hundreds upon hundreds of foes to battle against, and a similar number of non combatant 'innocents' to add flavour around town. Eight different races, and eight character classes provide a wide range of choices when it comes to tailoring your persona, with four large Guilds to join, and sub-guilds too at later levels.
The environment is non PvP, with a strong emphasis on roleplaying, the players ably assisted by the helpful staff to create a truly immersive gameworld. Help files are extensive, and all Guilds have their own mentor programs designed to ease newcomers into their new home. Cosrin is perfect for experienced roleplayers, who will fit right in and find the wealth of material they have to work with is only limited by their imagination. Cosrin is also *the* ideal choice for any true beginner, in both the roleplay and MUD sense - players use it's own trademark 'Wizard' front end to access it, which is fully configurable to your needs, but not so overwhelming that you are sent running for the hills by a three inch thick manual! 
Aside from the above, I can only suggest that you drop in and visit, you'll find plenty of people to help you upon your arrival, and we're always glad to see new faces across the bar!
See you there...first drink is on us...

AnimeMUD has been around for quite a long time, eight years 
strong, and many players have come and gone in that time.  
Having been players for as many years ourselves, we 
couldn't bear to watch it silently disappear.  So, we were
lucky enough to be able to continue it's legacy!  ...Wow!
How corny!  ..But anyway, many players have been satisfied,
and we hope you will be too.

Here at AnimeMUD we pay special attention to balance, making
sure everybody has an equal oppurtunity to enjoy the game,
regardless how.  We have a special RP bar where you can 
choose to relax and roleplay in an enviroment where you know
everyone else wants to RP too.  Our mud is very newbie 
friendly; if there's something you don't understand, just 
ask an immortal, and we'll help you any way we can!  If 
there's something you don't like about the mud, or wish to
see, just tell us!  We'll add it!  We're crazy like that.
So come check us out.  Why?  Because we're AnimeMUD.  ..Duh.

Description :

 In elden times, it is now said, Dragons ruled.  They created a civilization 
of immense beauty, sophistication, justice and law.  And then Sidal 
descended, and chaos ruled.  Now the races that were ur-races in Dragon
times are struggling for power and control in this modern age.  Humans
are ascendant from their main cities of New Draconia and Sidalicia, but
never discount the others; the Faea, Grulorten, Ertlorten, Korylani, Velinga
and Jotuni.

This mud features carefully crafted zones, with detailed descriptions which
change depending on daylight and season.  Mobs have personality, many 
offer quests, some offer puzzles, or jokes, many have tricks up their sleeves.
The world of Sidalicia is intended to age, rulers of kingdoms will change, years
and seasons will be marked in their passing.  Here weather and geography are
important, and magical control and knowlege of both is possible.  Sidalicia is
a new mud, just opened for players, and is therefore small and intimate.  It is
a complex mud in some ways, many things have been changed from stock
Circle, including the factors affecting combat.  Much thought has gone into
making Sidalicia original, thoughtful and absorbing.  Roleplaying is encouraged
but not strictly enforced and Sidalicia is exploring other ways, besides hack
and slash to advance a character (most based on questing and knowledge of
the MUD).  Come and join us, and fall under the spell of...  SIDALICIA!

 Welcome to The Razors Edge - one of the UK's
foremost online MUDs.  We suffered a server
failure and were forced to relocate.  The
interim downtime was several months - but
happily, the Edge has been back up and running
for long enough, and hopefully will continue
to do so for years to come.
 
The Razors Edge was actually begun in 1992 -
since then, countless modifications have been
added and integrated into the game, to make it
more exciting, more playable, and most
importantly, more enjoyable.. We 're now
operating v4.5 of the mud, and work is well
underway for R5 - which will bring in a whole
host of new features.
 
It would be very wrong to try to assign The
Edge to any particular genre, since it covers
a broad spectrum. Lots of original material
gives Razors a very rich and varied
environment to explore.

From the team that brought you EmpireMUD and Age of Destiny:
  The Banished Grounds: Legacy is the latest in a
series of MUDs I've written.  This is my first completely
from-scratch MUD so it's not quite finished yet, but I'm 
adding features constantly.

There is very little to do thus far, but we're working on
areas and other things players will need to.. play.  
The world has pair of maps which players can move 
around on, which helps displace the lack of other 
areas.  I'm working on adding features to the maps, 
they're mostly just ocean and fields right now.

Features include: skill-based classes (rather than class-
based skills), player- or npc-controlled kingdoms, and
the ability for players to choose their own path in life.

If you want to stop by and check it out, feel free.  During 
character creation, there may be menus without options 
on them.  Just hit 'done', I promise those things will be 
filled out soon.  You will be able to explore the small
continent which contains the administration building.
ALPHA TEST BEGINS SOON.

Description :

 Rebirth of Arda is the dreams of 2 people.  We are upgrading and changing
all the time and try to offer an environment that is receptive to player
input.  We offer clans, mobs that act as players IE they will hunt you down,
flee from you, and generally be a nuisance.  We also have done away with the
standard xp by time or alignment factor.  XP is gained on mud based on how
many times you kill a specific mob and how much higher or lower that mob is
then you.  Our mobs also do not have the standard 30k etc hp.  The mobs are
much closer to normal players.  We offer a wide range of races and classes
that can be fine tuned to your desires.  We made several changes of late.  
A new clan was added and an old one was deleted.  Now you can avoid pkill 
simply by not attacking anyone.  This removed the need for a non pkilling 
clan so now all clan members are subject to the rules of pkilling.  Another 
feature that is new is the ability for players to fine tune thier weapons 
thus adding new flags to them for a cost.  New things are always in the works 
at Arda and we welcome you to come give them a try.

 From the depths of our most feared nightmares came Aeon
Lue Chi Woe unto the realms of mortals.  From the blazing
ruins of Pancea he summoned forth the Shadoe Lords into

into the dojo, to do the bidding of their new master.
With half the cities of Keilar reeling from the ashes and
smoking remains of their battered strongholds, Lue Chi Woe
set forth on his errand of destruction.  With his power
the very continents themselves trembled, and a select 
group of the most powerful heroes of the land assembled to 
confront this deadliest of evils.

Description :

 The Aiian people have lived upon the island Sural for hundreds of
years, content with the knowledge that their goddess-given home was 
the only dry earth on the great blue sea. Matters have changed.

A new island has been discovered, its size undetermined, its land 
thick with dark, unexplored forest. Crowded conditions in Sural make 
this new land seem like a godsend, but is it? Now, one hundred years 
after the colony's inception, residents turn a wary eye to the 
uncleared forest about their tiny town-on-a-hill. 'Exactly what is 
out there', they ask themselves. But do they really wish to know?

Dark Horizon is a role-play intensive mud with a colonial/nautical 
theme. Players initially embody new colonists, freshly come to the 
island colony, grasping a deed their new home in-town. Role-play is 
key in DH, and players who perform their parts well will find new 
and exciting roles opening to them, both with their initial 
character, and suceeding ones. Our codebase offers a variety of new 
options, including an all-new wound system, a coordinate grid, far
seeing, sense specific echoes, and advanced ship and sea code.
     Come and join us, as the story unfolds in 'Dark Horizon'.

with the MUSH staff. Although the MUSH is not yet finished, we are also 
looking for a small group of players who are willing to play-test the MUSH. 
Feel free to drop on by and join in.

Hidden Agenda is set several years after the latest Star Trek film and is 
a MUSH focused on role-playing. A player can have alternate characters in 
different Empires and even enter the Mirror Universe featured on several
Star Trek episodes and play an alternate version of him or herself.

The MUSH staff are adapting a space system to simulate space travel to
aid Roleplay in the Star Trek universe and will have staff to help run
roleplaying plots and events. The MUSH staff would like all players to
take an active part in developing roleplaying ideas and events with
the emphasis on fun and not the restricive procedures found on many other 
Trek MU*.

Description :

Star Trek: Foundations is the first Star Trek-themed game based in
the era of the "Enterprise" TV show.  Star Trek: Foundations
(previously known as bDv) has been in production since 2001 and first
opened for players in 2002.  In the fall of 2004, it was announced
that the game was being redesigned from the ground up in terms of
code - a project which would streamline the game and ensure that all
aspects worked together.  ST:Foundations (bDv2) opened in March of
2005, and the playerbase was transferred over.  The game takes place
a few years after the show.  However, after 2154, we follow an
original timeline.

The year is 2163, and the galaxy is in turmoil. Many talks have been
initiated by various empires to discuss the need for an alliance of
major powers. The Terran Confederation is trying to prove itself to
larger, more-established empires like the proud Andorian Imperium or
the stoic Vulcan Federation. The warrior Klingon Empire shows little
mercy to those foolish enough to stand in the way of the Empire's
goals, and the secretive Romulans watch all from the safety of
cloaked vessels. Other, independent worlds are in the middle of it
all, some trying to make a profit while others side with larger
empires or conduct illegal business.

Will you play a part in forming an alliance of governments? Will you
command a raiding party of pirates? Will you lay siege to a weaker
empire, or will you foster the bonds of peace? All of these options
are available to you here.

Description :

 Dedicated to newbies and experienced players alike, NetherLand
features a huge, mostly original world of fantasy, providing
nearly limitless possibilities for exploration. For the 
pkillers, you can take part in a clan war, getting war points 
for your clan. For the explorer, you can hop on a horse (or, 
why not, a dragon) and use the automated quest system to get 
quest points that will be used to improve or modify your gear, 
while discovering new areas. For the newbies, you can be sure 
to receive help from your fellow players (we like the 'homely' 
atmosphere of a relatively small player base). If you ever get 
bored, you can participate in one of the regularly run games 
(capture the flag, treasure hunt, base domination to name a 
few). Or you could accumulate gold and buy your own castle! 
But the levelling possibilities are nearly limitless, with 
remorts (allowing multi-classing) and more than 300 races to 
choose from when you reincarnate.

New features are being implemented on a daily basis by the 
active immortal team. Check out our webpage, or just log on 
and check us out :)

Description :

   FieryMUD was origionally based on copper gamma and completly concept
initiated, hosted, coded and Implemented by Chris Camacho as this c
coding project that just went awry.  He'd no idea some psychos would
actually like it and play there all the time.  As a result of his
efforts in the face of an 'all frills or bust' mudding community he
quietly kept running one of the oldest Diku muds on the internet.
 
It has only taken massive hardware failure to allow Scott Davis a
crack at vaguely more modern code to allow FieryMUD interim possession
of a different and challanging player interface.  The origional vision
of FieryMUD was to create a challanging MUD for advanced players.
This new reborne Fiery is a hope to bring back the goals of the past
by inflicting certain death on unsuspecting players...  FieryMUD will
continue to grow and change through the coming years and those players
who seek challange and possess imagination will come in search of what
the 3D world fails to offer them....

  Chronicles of Aelia: Ages of Glory is a brand-new free
browser-based strategy/roleplaying game.  Coded entirely
with PHP, Ages of Glory requires nothing more than a recent
version of IE or MoZilla to play.  It has been extensively
beta-tested over a period of about a year to ensure stability
and balance.

Ages of Glory is a strong step ahead of most other free
browser-based games.  It features a graphical map and icons
rather than the pure text found in most free games.  A unique
combination of strategic and roleplaying elements, Ages of Glory
allows you to control individual characters thrust into the
middle of a world at war.  Train your skills, gather equipment
and ancient artifacts, amass a treasury, learn spells, and
enhance your power.  Build cities, recruit and train armies, and
lay enemy settlements to waste.

Inspired by Civilization, Master of Magic, Romance of the
Three Kingdoms, and popular browser games, Ages of Glory offers
an experience unlike any other, and at no cost.  So what are
you waiting for?

in the utter silence of dark thoughts and dreams. Hate and

as It plans another assualt on those who live and breath.
It is confident. It is patient. It will win. Eternity is on
Its side.

        Floods of terrified refugees choke the utopian
society of Valistadt with people uttering whispered tales
of violent and destructive walking dead that feel no pain
and show no mercy; the terror sweeping across the lands 
that lay beyond the protective enclave of Dragon's Maw.
Ignorant of the great forces behind it all, and deceptively
certain of the safety within the massive towering walls of 
Valistadt, commoners live from day to day in the bustling
streets, and night by night hidden away within their 
homes.. for few have the courage to slip into the true
reality of the darkened streets of the City where sin and
decadence provoke the Evil unwittingly.

   Players can play any race they like though we do not have
an actual race system. We felt that allowing players to
customize themselves through stats was less restrictive than
a set of races that predefine attributes such as strength
and intelligence. Players can write descriptions and adjust
their stats to be any race they choose.

   We've got an increasing number of guilds available for
players to choose from and a wide variety of realms for
people to tempt fate in.

   Player killing is available between people who choose to
become members of the secretive Blood Cult but people who
don't feel like player killing will not have to worry.

     We are currently looking for builders and will make sure

the land fought upon. 
  
     The gods couldn't bare the beasts fighting and split 
up the orb which then became the six elemtents, fire, water, 
  wind, earth, bane and virtue. Each elemental source became a
race. Fire became the Daemon, water became the Saturos, wind
became the Avain, earth became the Rakaar, virtue became the
Human, and bane became the Slith.
     
     With the six orbs distribed between the races,
each used their share of the power differently. Traveling
through time, going to every different point in time, races
trying to take over different time periods. Chaos arose,
time was disrupted and now there is a need to fix it.

**We Have Moved Servers, Please see the New IP Listed Above!!!**

The realms of King Arthur have changed. Centuries have passed and
there are new threats to the security of Camelot. With the crowning
of King Larardo Pendragon, an evil faction known as The Farlands
Empire has sprung up to counter the rule of King Larardo.

The Elven Counsel has convened and Dhanloria is thrust into what is
sure to be another realm war.

Trust no one. Hide your wife and children. The deities of this world
will enjoy what is about to fall.

The Knights of the Round Table have been disbanded. All that separates
you from victory is the skills you have learned, and the amount of
trust you place in each of your clansmen.

The battle cry has been sounded, do you heed or flee?


You will NOT be disappointed!

WWW         : None
Description :

  Mithreal is a Middle Earth/Medieval oriented MOO based on a
unique theme that is still in the development process. Its
core lies in a race called the Serydians, the first and
only race created directly by the gods. Their power is
ancient and strong, working with the very essence of the
Universe. This essence, called Lifeforce, is divided into
five parts: Fire Energy, Water Energy, Earth Energy, Air
Energy, and Electrical Energy. Serydians delve in the arts
of working with these energies. Ages ago, a group of
Serydians broke away and claimed themselves to be the gods.
A war broke out that left much of the universe in ruin.
Peace was once again restored and the consorters were
banished from the Serydian lands to other worlds. One of
them was Earth, where Mithreal takes focus. Those who were
banished also lost their memories, and thus developed
different cultures and race mutations over time. Many of
these races are what are commonly thought of in Middle
Earth: elves, humans, dwarves and their like. Others are
unique to Mithreal.

This is just a condensed form of the theme. A better, more
complete version will be available as soon as it is done
being written.

Description :

 The 1st Dawn of Reason is an extremely challenging, thoroughly 
engrossing reality. From the moment you log in, you will be 
enchanted by the vivid, full ansi color descriptions, and the 
highly intricate, refreshingly logical and internally consistent 
structure to an extent which you have undoubtedly never 
before experienced.

DoR runs on its own machine and connection, and is exceptionally 
well-balanced and fair.  Anti-cheating rules are actually enforced.  
You can be proud of your achievements on DoR, as people do not gain 
levels by exploiting bugs or imbalances.

DoR is a challenging mud.  Those looking for a place they can
become powerful overnight will be disappointed.  However, it is
the perfect mud for someone looking to earn their levels, and
to be able to take pride in making it to High Mortal, because it
is not something just anyone can do.

When you check out DoR for yourself, you will see a well developed 
fantasy world that has room for humor and parody.  It is not just 
a mud; to those who know it, it is another dimension.

Description :

Astalyn; a continent recently inhabited by resourceful pilgrims
fleeing the oppressive theocracy of their previous kingdom. Veins 
of ancient magic run deep within this land, surfacing in gifted 
individuals.

Promising laws offer unprecedented fairness to formerly 
oppressed farmers, and the new kingdom stands on the cusp of 
rising into a booming trade empire.

However, the throne of this great land of promise is occupied 
by a king  of failing health, while an appointed Regent maintains
order in place of the fading king. No successor to the throne has 
been chosen yet, and many members of the nobility seek to attract 
the king's favor. Across seas to the east, the kingdom of Cathien 
keeps watch over the large island with its fragile regency, the 
glint of potential opportunity in its eyes.

Connect to Astalyn and enjoy RP in a fantasy-medieval setting. You
can choose the path of the humble commoner, or seek to shape the 
fate of the kingdom.

OOC: We're avidly seeking new players! From the simplest peasants 
to our available upper class positions, we're looking for people 
to bring life to Astalyn. Come RP in a malleable environment where
the future is far from set in stone, and you and your character 
may have a hand in many developments! With a small grid and 
active staff, Astalyn offers many RP opportunities. Log in now
and take a look! Feel free to page Griffin, Dragon, or Phoenix

Description :

Forgotten Evil is a friendly mud with nice blend of 
roleplay and hack'n'slash. A player may get experience 
through killing mobs, questing or roleplaying. FE's main 
goal is to provide a fun world to 'live' in. 

Forgotten Evil has many features including, an introduction
system, morgue, seperate OOC rooms, advanced language systems,
pets and mounts, a working casino, bury and dig up items, 
ability to subdue an opponent as an alternative to killing. 

When a player reaches hero status, they are given the 
ability to remort as in many muds. They are also allowed
to restring their own items, and use the 'switch' command,
to possess mobs for RP purposes.

Players should stay in character, they don't need to 
spew out thee and though's, just keep ooc and ic seperated.

Forgotten Evil is currently looking for Builders and 
another coder. If you would like to see your work on 
a mud, feel free to stop by!

 The MOO begins right around the beginning of the X-Men Evolution
series, right around the beginning episodes.  The MOO itself has
been around for about 2 years, though just now truly opening for
players.

 X-Men: Evolution is, essentially, the X-Men as teenagers with a few
exceptions.  Storm, Wolverine, Magneto, Professor Xavier, and a few
others are the only true exceptions to the 'teenager' part of the
equation.  The Xavier Institute is located in the small town of
Bayville in this version of the X-Men theme, with a small town and
high school the possibility for interaction with others is almost
limitless.  The various parts of the theme are the same as other
X-men storylines, Xavier leading the X-Men and ultimately Magneto
leading the Brotherhood.

 We encourage RP of all sorts, tiny plots are welcome, and good
players are needed for many feature characters.  Despite the
relative early start of the theme in the series there are feature
characters available that were not introduced till the second or
third season.

 Come check us out, be one of the X-men, make up your own character,
but come join the fun.

Description :

  AVP: Legend is growing more complete by the day. The Marine race
is mostly functional, and so is the Alien. Predator development is
also way on its way.

AVP: Legend will provide a PK mud with several new twists to MUD 
combat, including free-roaming combat, hostages, highly interactive
enviroments, cover objects, and many other features. Expect a good 
team-oriented fight system with the three extremely developed races.

The Alien is an excellent unit for the hack-and-slashers and 
'key spammers', it has the fastest attack speed in the game, but is 
also the easiest to kill in ranged combat, because it doesn't have 
one of its own. 

The Marine is a potent weapon of destruction, wielding a massive 
arsonal of weapons, ranging from automatic pistols, to assault rifles,
to rocket launchers. Perfect for the equipment and tech-minded players, 
as it relies heavily on staying stocked up on weapons and choosing the
right ones.

The Predator is a mix of both speed and damage, mixing stealth with 
weapons. Great for very strategy-minded players, the Predator is the
hardest race of all to master.

What makes Zeb great?

We have dedicated newbie helper players, or if you prefer,
a newbie tutorial (in the game, not in a MUD school).

All our areas are fully reviewed before activation. We have
a wide variety of original objects and imaginative opponents,
and 25 challenging quests.

Our 7 (and counting) classes play totally differently! 
Play a Necromancer and control a group of 30 minions - real 
monsters that follow and obey you. Or play an Alchemist and 
have to search the MUD for spell components.

Playerkilling is allowed above level 1 but is carefully 
balanced (and we find it makes the game much more interesting!)

At level 20 players become a Legend, and gain access to 
more items. They get more skills, and an Estate to defend.

Zebedee is a popular traditional LPMUD that has been running
for 10 years, but with an international user base. Our loyal 
players will testify to its quality :)

opportunity to apply to play any race you can think of.  A Dragon?  An imp?  A shade?  
On FL the only limit is that of your own imagination.  If there is something you want that 
is not here, chances are that it is in development.

New to the concept of MUDs?  No problem.  In addition, FL boasts one of the most 
newbie-friendly systems available, and with immortals from locations spanning the 
globe; there is seldom a moment where one is not available and eager to answer any of 
your questions.  Load up your client, and connect.  You haven’t got a thing to lose.

particolare per la gestione degli immortali che, in seguito al 
cammino intrapreso in vita mortale, potranno giocare ulteriori 36 
livelli con una concezione di gioco ben piu' elevata dell'hack&slash, 
basata esclusivamente sullo sviluppo della propria religione. Se non 
bastasse, Silmaril conta su una comunita' di giocatori poco ampia ma 
molto compatta, che ha sempre dimostrato di saper accogliere neofiti 
per guidarli alla conoscenza di questo stupendo mondo.

In this Italian MUD, players can choose between 9 starting races and 
15 professions in a Tolkien-influenced fantasy world, where they can 
explore a wide world and fight their wars, joining quests and founding 
clans and guilds to decide the realm's fate.

The AD&D rules exert great influence on the Mud's structure, 
especially about Immortals who, after a chosen way in their mortal 
lives, could play 36 further levels, developing their personal 
religions and disregarding the hack&slash way of life.
Besides, Silmaril is constituted by a not large group of very united 
players, who always have received newbies, leading them to the 
discovery of this wonderful world.

Description :

Forgotten Dreams: Prelude to light is descended from the old mud
Forgotten Dreams III which was popular and sadly closed. FDIII was in
turn a descendant of the old Battle of the Immortals code. BotI is
now being reborn. New Immortals have taken up management and coding
and are striving to create a fun and popular mud. We are a PK
oriented mud based in medieval times. FD loosely follows the RP of
Whitewolf's popular World of Darkness game, and uses a class system
much like that on old Godwars muds, but with several years of modified
code. Classes include many of the golden oldies as well as several 
unique classes like Mimics and Druids. Recently the unique Angel class
was completed as well as the Hunter class.  The old class Warmage has
also been revamped and reimplemented and open to all. We also have a
fun automated quest system which runs various global questes every 
hour. The quest system scatters quest tokens, collectible items (like 
cards which can be redeemed for equipment), exp tokens, mobs, all 
sorts of fun stuff. We also hold quests by immortals when there are 
many people online, and often give away prizes :)  We are currently 
working on a much more in-depth clan system, with clan powers and
struggles, encouraging the RP aspect of the mud. The playerbase is
currently growing, and it is very dedicated. The imms are friendly,
understanding, and the mud in general is very newbie friendly. If you
want to have some fun drop by and play a little, you might just like
it and choose to stay :) An offline area editor is currently under
construction by Ailen.  The builder is is nearing completion and is
designed to specifically work with our code and we look forward to the
many unique areas that will be built. Olc is also in the works for
people interested in building online. 

*Note for those new to the mud, although the exp may be small, the 
amount needed to gain skills is also small*

Description :

  Martian Dreams MUSH is a player-friendly, heavy-roleplay
MUSH based on an original sci-fi theme. The focus is on the
lives and struggles of citizens of the newly-established 
Martian Republic. 

After decades of oppression and exploitation, the Mars 
colony has finally achieved independence from Earth. But 
with this new-found freedom comes a host of new problems. 
The Martian economy is in shambles, factions vie for the 
right to shape the future of the fledgling Martian 
Republic, and Earth has traded a war of bullets and bombs 
for one of economics and bureaucracy. 

On the rim of Mars' vast Grand Canyon, the inhabitants of 
the Martian city Waycross face a host of dangers. Yet this 
does not deter them from their quest to rise from the ashes 
and form a new nation. A nation built on the dreams of 
pioneers, and the blood of patriots.

Description :

 In the 1800s, a scholar by the name of Dr. Laurent Sorbonne
established the Societe of Shangri-La on the belief that 
mankind's dreams could actually create another world. After 
years of study and arcane ritual, he and his followers 
succeeded, opening a portal to a world unseen by Man, a
land of incredible beauty. A paradise. It was then
discovered that the form one took upon passing through the
portal was entirely variable, and seemed rooted in the 
dreams (or nightmares) and fantasies of the entrant...

Shangrila is a fantasy roleplay BDSM mush that seeks to 
provide a safe environment for adults to explore their 
sexuality in the rich theme or go where their imaginations 
take them in one of the many OOC (out of character) areas. 
The possibilities are endless: fantastical, sci-fi, furry.
We welcome all players who are of legal age and have open
minds.

WWW         : http://www.sgmoo.com
Description :

Scattergood MOO is a Harry Potter based roleplaying game in
which players take on roles as students in a school
stationed in Colorado, USA. It is a completely original
idea, an 'Americanized' school without the Houses that
Hogwarts sponsors. Instead students are placed under one
of the five Advisors we have (sort of counselors).

While it's set in the 1990's (book time), history has been
modified so Voldemort has and will never come to power.
Besides the main school we have extra areas, like Schiller
Academy, which is a school where the Dark Arts are taught
freely to students in addition to their other studies. 

Scattergood is a newbie friendly MOO, but we require
players to adjust quickly to the use of decent English
skills. There aren't any quests or coded spells, it's all
roleplayed to allow the complete freedom of choice to our
players. The game's lots of fun and we're always looking
new ideas and thoughts, so the more creative and inventive
you are, the farther and faster you're going to advance to
options of picking special characters.

Description :

  Legend of Dracon II is the culmination of over five years
worth of work.  It is a product of the collective effort of
many dedicated GameMaster, builders, and playtesters.

Instead of calling ourselves a MUD, we at Legend of Dracon
II refer to ourselves as an IRPA, an Interactive RolePlaying
Adventure.  Our emphasis at Legend of Dracon II is RolePlaying.

Legend of Dracon II offers some very unique code.  We have
reworked the magic system to include the ability for mage-
types to increase the power of their spells by investing
extra trains into them.  Our clerical classes have also
been reworked to include different spell groups based upon
the god worshipped by the cleric.

Perhaps the highlight of Legend of Dracon II is the
diversity and uniqueness of each character class.  To this
end, we have almost 450 skills and spells that help
define each class as a unique entity, not simply a
combination of a few other standard classes.

Ride, boldly ride,' The shade replied-  'If you seek for Eldorado!'

warrior, originally created by powerful magicians for battle, 
members of your race are identical in appearance except for the 
tattoos that decorate your body telling other Thralls who you are 
and your accomplishments. Or do you follow the almighty Aa and have 
given yourself to him as is custom for all Aamanians? Do you wield 
the might to rise through the ranks of your order to become a
legendary Defender of the faith, slaying heretics as you find them; 
or do you prefer to frolic underground in the deep caverns of Terra 
and harvest the mighty crystals from her womb that brings wealth to 
your people as a Gnomekin? Or might you be the Kang, from the far 
eastern world, tall and fierce with fiery red skin, white pupil-less 
eyes and brutal features, your hair pulled strait back in a
single queue which is worn long and decorated and is a mark of pride 
in your culture. You body is covered with scars from Kanjiko, a form

     This Tolkien-based mud has been around for as long

wonderful and extensive monster, item, and character
database, this mud is famous among Mordor fans and non-
Mordor fans alike for its diversity and it's mix of
exciting combat and depth of its monster and item database.

     The combat system is loosely based on D&D and AD&D,
and people familiar with the combat system of these famous
games will no doubt enjoy the experience of playing on
Isengard.  There are constant improvements and new areas
being added.

     With the addition of clans, guilds, and player shops,
this mud has quite a bit of depth while maintaining the
simplicity that it has always been known for.

makes you stronger, richer or more powerful than the average
player, you need an equal negative that is your character's weak-
ness. The weakness doesn't have to be publicly known but we don't
allow indestructible characters or invulnerable demi-gods.

world that is only limited by the confines of your imagination. The

Description :

  Zombie the Awakening has been up since 1995, and still
undergoes constant improvement.  Character Creation allows 
for players to create unique characters, and it's possible 
to Reincarnate and redesign the character if the player 
desires (though it comes with a price).  The world is quite 
large and is constantly expanding, as a team of builders 
toil endlessly (really!  endlessly! we're serious!) to 
ensure that new and interesting things are always ready to 
be discovered.  Several immortals are available for helping 
new players with any questions or problems they might have, 
so even those new to MUDs in general should have minimal 
difficulty in getting started.  One of the key features of 
ZombieMUD is that upon dying, a player does not have to go 
back and hunt down their corpse to get their hard-earned 
equipment back.  Instead, they turn into zombies, who must 
locate the nearest temple to be returned to life.  To 
summarize, ZombieMUD is a unique and fascinating experience 
that's likely to leave you deprived of sleep and too busy 
playing to care, so why not try it out now?

but not take its place. Some areas are still under construction
and builders are always welcome. Characters which do not require
administrative approval to start include hobbits, elves, orcs,
and humans. Other types of characters are also available on a
limited basis. OneRing is still a very small MUSH, so there are
not always players connected at any given time. Automatic scripts
to keep you logged in while you idle around are perfectly
acceptable.

Description :

 Village Rivals has been up for about five years.  We
have gone through a couple of bad hosts, which led
to the MUD being down for some time through that
period.  After we have been back up for
approximately six months on our latest server, we
have regained a large number of our former players
and almost all of our active coding staff.  This is
because the people, atmosphere, rooms, guilds, and
other aspects of the MUD are friendly and 'homey'.

 We have five guilds currently in play, with a couple
more in the making.  The currently open guilds
include:
 * Adventurers (we have a real Adventurers' guild)
 * Clerics (with twelve deities to choose from &
   200+ spells and powers)
 * Rogues (with four orders to choose from & many
   skills)
 * Vampires (with five clans to choose from & many
   powers)
 * Barbarians (with 25 skills and more to raise)

 We are also re-implementing our Village Rival
system, which is a simulated player killing system,
that allows players of one Village's citizenship
fight those of others.  Dying in these wars does not
have any effect on the player's normal character!

Drop by and try the MUD, you're sure to enjoy it.

We pride ourselves on our unique and challenging quests,
as simple as 'rescue the lost kitten' to as complex as
exploring an Egyptian tomb full of traps and powerful undead.
The game's areas are hand-drawn on detailed maps which you
can view as you explore each room.  Our Guild system provides
a blend of race and class abilities, while our Clans give
more roleplaying opportunities.  We're constantly updating
the mudlib and driver code to add functionality and reduce
lag.  We're a light-hearted group who don't take ourselves too 
seriously and just strive to relax, make friends, and 
maybe slay an orc or two. :) Come on in and take a

Mud         : Anarres II
Code Base   : [Custom] MudOS A2-0.99.x series experimental LP driver
Telnet      : mudlib.anarres.org 5000 [195.82.114.164]
WWW         : http://www.anarres.org/projects/mud/
Description :

 Anarres II is an LPMud written from scratch with the objective of creating
a powerful and versatile LPC library. The library environment for
creators is modelled on the Unix operating system with clones of many
important Unix daemons and commands. Features include an extensible
capability based security system and extensible in-shell scripting. Anarres
II uses an internal messaging system to allow internal and external AIs
to interact with the world on the same basis as human players.

In mid 2001, the emphasis of Anarres II turned to building area code to
demonstrate the library, but development of the driver and the library
are actively ongoing as ever.

We encourage technically minded visitors to drop in and have a look
around, the codebase is visible from when you log in. The regular users
have backgrounds in a wide variety of both technical (and nontechnical)
disciplines and welcome discussion.

Mud         : Arcana
Code Base   : [MOO] modified GhostCore on MOO version 1.8.0p6
Telnet      : mistwalker.org 7777 [192.189.3.126]
WWW         : http://mistwalker.org/
Description :

  It may happen any time, anywhere, in a passing moment: a 
half-heard whisper reaches your ears, a voice both familiar 
and strange, calling your name. You turn to look - and no-
one is there.  The mists are close to you, friend, and they 
hover around each of us.

Those who step in never return to tell what they see on the 
other side. Perhaps there is nothing but death waiting for 
those who follow the path.  Perhaps, however, they find
their way at last through the mists, into Arcana, the land 
within the mists, a world that exists only on the 
sufferance of the Higher Power that supports it and the 
Three that oversee it.  

Arcana as a roleplay world owes its conception and 
allegiance to the myriad fantasy authors its creators have 
read - most chiefly among them C.S. Lewis, but also 
including the Master himself (J.R.R. Tolkein), Robert 
Jordan, Marion Zimmer Bradley, and many others...Please 
treat it with respect.

WWW         : http://www.newworlds-rpg.com
Description :

 New Worlds is a full featured Roleplaying Game. Offering several unique
and powerful guilds, races, politics, religion, justice, economy, and a
storyline that is mostly player controlled.

 The administration does not control Gods or Kings or other power NPCS in
order to control players. We let the players do the dictating on where the
plotlines evolve so long as it follows the genre and the structure of the
main storyline.

 The key to our game is that we not only stress roleplaying, we demand it!
While you can fight and adventure and battle in New Worlds, the first
element of the game is Roleplaying.

 This game is also sponsored. There is no cost associated for players. No
advertising, no emails, no donations, no nothing associated with costs. The
game is Free in the purest sense of the word.

 The bottom line with this mud is simple: Play it for a week, and show your
style of roleplay, and we guarantee you will find a home here. The proof of
our excellent roleplayer base is that we have about a 40/60 ratio of women
and men players.

 Check it out, you won't be disappointed (unless you can't roleplay).

 ****
 We encourage you to visit the website to see the features of this game.

 While our player base is just beginning to grow, realize that we just
opened in June of 2004, and if you want to be part of the growing storyline,
we would advise you to check out the game soon.

control of a keep for your clan.  We have implemented a
huge clan system which includes many titled ranks for
members, huge clan compounds, clan treasuries and many
other unique features.  The newest change that we are very
excited about is our own unique mobile trigger system which
has been implemented alongside an 'active quest' system.
Take part in huge quest arcs that make it seem as though
the creatures are interacting with you just as much as you
are with them.

Description :

 Humans coexist tenuously with each other and the nonhuman races,
Mren (feline) and Rrel (canine).  An age before, the Dragons were
wiped out, only a few eggs surviving.  Now the time has come for
the young Dragons to hatch, bringing back their old, forgotten
magic - and new powers besides.  Their presence has the potential
to inflame the already strained relations between the three
human-ruled nations...
 
While humans are the dominant species, players are encouraged
to apply for Mren and Rrel original characters as well.  All
species are vital to the MUCK's main plot - and while there is a
MUCK-wide storyline, players are encouraged to come up with
their own ideas, be they small or large.  Larger ones should be
passed by the staff first, however - and in all issues, the
staff is always willing to offer advice, answer questions, and
help however they can.

Description :

(The Eternal Forest is a derivative of The Forest's Edge
 base)

The world of the Eternal Forest stems from the depths of
fantasy, a world in which conjurers and con artists mingle
with warmongers and holymen.  It is a realm where clans
battle for superiority...as do individuals who care nothing
for the unity the organizations provide.

It is a world of high fantasy, imagery with which everyone
is familiar, though the texture of the world is different.
New cities, forests, swamps...areas of all kinds wait to be
explored by the brave and to claim the lives of the
cowardly.

Come and explore this brave, new world...join those who
have already survived the seasons of The Eternal Forest.

Special Features Include:

Many additional areas have been added to this code base. 
Settable aliases. 
Automated auction. 
All items/pets save and there is no rent. 
Introduction/Befriend Commands with no limits. 
Mail System. 
Reagent based magic system with spells that can be leeched. 
Shops can customize items given the correct ingredients. 
Hierarchy based skill system where skills improve with use. 
Multiple items treated correctly, i.e. 2*loaf = two loaves of bread. 
Races which make a difference - trolls can eat corpses, etc. 
Banks which can store gold as well as equipment. 
Socials that vary from race to race

WWW         : http://www.aelfhame.net/~denver/
Description :

  Denver is now THE most popular Shadowrun MUSH on the Internet.
A quick thanks to all the players who are making this possible is
in order.

  Shadowrun - Denver is oriented towards players who have had
some experience in RPing in Shadowrun, whether online or in TT
play. It has a very friendly, open atmosphere between players and
staff, and is intended for people to have fun, not model a
'realistic' Shadowrun world. To apply, connect to the MUSH, read
the application policy, and follow the instructions there.

  Our chargen has often been said to have the best code of any
of the Shadowrun MUSHs. You can create anything from a gun-toting
Street Samurai to a Rogue Doctor plying the shadows to help who
he can and make a profit. We are currently using SR3, Magic in
the Shadows, the Cannon Companion, Man and Machine, the Matrix,
some portions of Rigger 3, and State of the Art. All character
types are welcome, with no slot restrictions.

  For more information, why not visit our Web site? The document
system has been fully integrated into our home page - you can
view the +news and +help online without even logging in! You can
also use the Java based MUSH client on our page to log in to the
MUSH from any computer connected to the 'net.

WWW         : http://stardart.funkychickendesign.com/
Description :

  Star Dart alpha is an engrossing Java-based combat mud,
where your only quest is to surpass the other players and
achieve galactic domination.

Star Dart alpha became stable in January 2002, and new
features are still being added on a daily basis. We
encourage players to interact with the development team
in-game and in our forums, and this interaction is
frequently the basis of upgrades to the game.

Unique to Star Dart alpha is the concept of a periodic
reset of the universe; depending on the arena, the universe
may revert to it's unaltered original form at some interval
between a few hours and a week, depending on how the admins
have set up the arena. This way players can chose their
their level of committment to the game (since playing Star
Dart alpha is generally an intense experience).

Description :

  Nightmist Online is a Partially Text-based MuD ( Multi-User Dungeon).
That is to say, there are many players from around the world at the same
time interacting together. You begin by generating your own character,
with strengths and weaknesses which are individual to you. You choose your
class, and your race. Next you are put into a medieval world, where there
are monsters, and players, shops, taverns, guilds, and all sorts of other
things. What will you do? Perhaps you will seek out the legendary Gorgon
Beast, and bring back some trophy? Or maybe you would prefer to become a
thief, hiding and stealing gold off players and monsters. It is your choice,
so choose wisely!

The best way to experience this game is for you and some friends to
download it, and play together. It can be a little confusing at first, but
there is an ingame help section (activated by typing 'help' at any time).
Remember, have fun!

The Background of Nightmist is available from www.nightmist.co.uk

Coastal Legends is custom-written MUD, designed according to the new D'n'D
(3rd Edition) rules.  If you're into Dungeons and Dragons, we invite you
to visit!

Our combat engine has been coded completely from scratch, and features a 
unique grid-like system that makes range and line-of-sight possible.  This
makes combat a more tactical experience than pure hack 'n slash.

Additional MUD features:
o DM-led campaigns for adventuring parties.
o Roleplaying strongly encouraged: up to 15-20% of your experience may come
  from roleplaying awards.
o Designed for D'n'D players, by D'n'D players; not an AOL kiddie chatroom.
o Intelligent NPCs give pursuit when attacked, and automatically reselect
  their targets when 'tanking' is detected.
o Huge 'Outside' map: Over 210,000 virtual rooms to date.
o Baldur's Gate style 'Journal' keeps track of important events and notes.
o Totally custom: mudlib and world written from scratch, nearly 1 year in
  development.
o Our own MUD client: http://www.coremud.org/legends/wincore.html

As of this writing, Coastal Legends is a few months away from officially
opening, but players are welcome to login and help us playtest.  Please see

  Fool's Moon: Legacy, is set in the modern world.  The city 
is Trois Portes, a centre of culture found on the border 
between Quebec and Ontario, about an hour's drive north of 
New York State.  Fool's Moon is set on Earth, in a world 
very much like our own, but with a strong connection to the 
mythic races, and with technology and abilities beyond 
normal understanding hidden in the shadows and behind 
closed doors.  The theme is secrecy and misunderstanding - 
the Races know they are outnumbered, and can not tell what 
humans around them are normal humans, and which are 
potentially going to turn into Hunters at the briefest 
exposure to what is actually out there.  This is not a MUCK 
about powers, this is place is about learning what is out 
there, and surviving in a world which may turn on you 
without warning.

Description :

  Set to open in J.R.R Tolkien's Middle-earth in the year 2460
of the Third Age, Shadows of Isildur is a role-play 
intensive MUD that focuses on the conflict between the 
mighty citadels of Minas Tirith - the bastion of power of 
the exalted descendents of the fabled Numenorean empire - 
and Minas Morgul, the once-shining spire conquered and 
subverted by the Witchking of Angmar to serve his own
sinister, and as of yet unknown, purposes.

New players can choose to take the role of either a human in
the grand kingdom of Gondor, or a goblin under the 
Witchking's malefic reign; as the player accumulates 
roleplay points to their account, more races and roles will 
open up to them during the creation of their next character.
We are roleplay enforced; in-character behavior is mandatory
at all times, and characters here are by application only.

Our building is absolutely top-notch, as is our coding, our 
playerbase, and our staff. If you are a fan of Tolkien, an 
avid roleplayer, or both, I encourage you to check us out! 
All are welcome, from the most die-hard Middle-earth 
afficionados to those who weren't even aware of its 
existence until now. Come join us!

Description :

'We started developing on the 11th of October, 2002 with a 
stock CircleMud3.0pl19. By now most major interaction parts 
have been rewritten. Among other stuff, we added a command 
based online-building-system, rewrote the combat-, spell-,
and skill-system and added a completely integrated scripting
language called Mumps. ' - Axel, Implementor of Code

WARP is a reasonably new mud set in the fantasy world of
Warhammer, more specifically the Old World. WARP offers
players the chance to take up arms for the free people
of the Old World, join Greenskins in their quest for
plunder or join the Skaven as they hunt for more precious
warpstone.

Currently with a small playerbase, the mud focuses on
player-killing aspects, with characters competing for a
valuable spot on the list of renowned warlords by slaying
foes from opposite sides of the war (Men, Elves and Dwarves
are the free people, Black Orcs, Orcs, Forest Goblins and
Night Goblins making up the greenskin side, and Skaven
having no allies).

Description :

'I'm mad, you're mad. We're all mad here.' -- Cheshire cat
 
The Twisted Kingdom is the hinterlands between reality and madness. A place
where gods and monsters stalk the mist, where dreams and nightmares define
reality. For most, it is the greyness of shock at tragic news. For others,
the thin line of lucidity as they plunge into the abyss. Some, though, some
lucky few manage to land there, balanced precariously on the razor edge of
sanity. The rest?  Well, they're born there.
 
Ashes to ashes, and dust to dust, or mist, as the case might be. Most
denizens of the mists, are made of the mist. Expelled fully formed from
it's depths to live their alloted time seperate. In some cases whole, in
others .. not. Some of these fantastic creatures banded together, forming
packs, then tribes, and in time grew to cities and kindgoms, carefully
tending the land their dreams made, defending themselves from the
nightmares, organizing religions, making machines, and learning to live
beside that which gave them life, and that which will someday, take it
away.
 
They grew old, their children and grand children matured, and eventually,
returned to the mists from which they were born. And that is where you find
yourself, thrown into the lucid illusion, or born there, or merely passing
through on your decent into madness. There are gods you may pray to, if you
think it'll help. It probably won't. The gods are sometimes more trouble
than they're worth, but they certainly make life interesting.

Mud         : Star Wars Roleplaying Forum
Code Base   : [MUSH] PennMUSH
Telnet      : rpforum.org 9999 [68.90.68.66]
WWW         : http://rpforum.org
Description :

  The Star Wars Roleplaying Forum is an interactive, online forum 
for storytelling set in the Star Wars universe. It is the marriage of two
ideas: 

- The Forum Project for Interactive Fiction, a set of principles and ideas
behind community-based fiction developed over the last several years, and 

- Our interpretation of the Star Wars Universe. Ours is significantly darker
than 'canon' Star Wars, since we do not pander to children and are not
interested in selling merchandise. We try to forget, for example, that Ewoks
or Gungans exist. This is a universe in which people struggle to survive and
fight for their freedom, and they bleed when injured. It's 'Star Wars Noir.'


The Star Wars Roleplaying Forum is the first MUSH to drop the idea of the
virtual universe in favor of the community forum approach. More details on
our philosophy can be found here: http://rpforum.org/revolution.html. 

Our goal is to provide the community with the tools it needs to create
stories, player-run and player-driven plots, and conflict resolution systems
that enhance and encourage roleplaying instead of arcade-style combat. To
that end, we have designed and built several systems to support our ideas: 

- An entirely new, turn-based space system adapted from the d20 revised
space system and built from scratch 

- A Guest GM system that grants regular players temporary GM authority over
players who accept it 

- A scene manager that takes care of the math behind initiative calculation
and handles pose order, but doesn't make you use coded '+attacks' or
anything of the sort 

- An NPC library for GMs to create and maintain hundreds of unique
characters as well as basic templates and give them the props they need.

Description :

  Founded 5 July 1991 in Aachen, Germany, Dragon has been online consistently
for over 12 years, longer than any other AberMUD. In that time, Dragon has
evolved, yet remains true to a tradition of friendship and fun, welcoming
players new and old. Many MUD Gods ran on Dragon in their newbie days and
joined our venerable wizlist. We'd love to see your name there, too.

Dragon uses a modified Dyrt 1.0 codebase and retains most classic AberMUD
features as well as offering many unique zones and mobiles. 27 quests are
available, some of them exclusive to Dragon, with various new quests in the
works. Dragon is an old-style mud with periodic Resets, so players are wise
to remember where their favourite equipment can be found and make maps so
they don't get lost. Combat is simple, but will become more challenging as
we add skills and spells. Playerkilling is not allowed except in the arena
and PK tournaments.

We invite you to enter the Dragon. Adventure, explore and enjoy!

 Welcome to the home of Anime Mayhem on the net. This is 
the place where imagination will surely be able to come to
life. More than a mere MUD, I have very big plans for this
server. I've been doing a lot of design at this stage hence
code development comes in bursts. Please read on to learn
more about the system. Essentially Anime Mayhem is an
interactive game world. Anime Mayhem is roughly a MUD in
design but several additional features allow for
interaction in other ways not present in typical MUDs. One
of the particularly special proposed aspects of Anime
Mayhem is the public storybook that is generated, based on
what's gone on in the system, more-or-less when it happens.
It is possible to script some things that happen in the
system but for the most part the players will be the ones
evoking the tales of adventure in Anime Mayhem!

Description :

 In the year After Colony 196, Zechs Marquise was succesful in dropping
the Battleship: Libra onto Earth, and thereby turned the Earth into a
baren wasteland.  However, White Fang's reign over space was short lived,
as the remnants of the Earth Sphere Unified Nation reformed on M02 and
independant colonies to oppose them.  Oz also reformed, seeming to oppose
any order which was not there own.  The Maganac Core split off from the
ESUN and created there own elite group of mercinaries.  Later on, the
refugees from the destroyed Earth took to Mars in a massive terraforming
project which brought about the creation of New Earth. Some of the cities
from the old earth have been reconstructed there, and most of the old
earths population have fled to it.  Those remaining on the old earth fell
into different clans, and wage war for pitiful reasons on one another.
And as for the Gundam Pilots, they all dissapeared into different parts of
the galaxy, humiliated and beaten, never wanting to show themselves again. 
 
 The fate of the galaxy is in your hands, what will you do with the fate of
mankind?

 This MUD is oriented around the anime series of Gundam Wing. We offer clans, 
a high level for training, a PK system which even works while in suits. 
Customizable suits, a targettable suit system. Many mini games, gambling. 
A building port for anyone who wants to build for the MUD, and much MUCH more.
More will be added as time goes on, seeing as how we have plenty of ideas.

         Things in the world are hardly as simple as they once

we live our lives. 

         So many have lost their lives, so many innocent 
children, mothers, fathers, brother...so many lives lost to 
prejudice...so many... 

         Was it our ways that brought about this world we live 
in? Was it our pollution? Was it the drugs, the sex, the 
disease? Was it the nuclear power? The radiation? The 
chemicals? Or was it something more? The next step in 
evolution? The next chapter in the world of man, the supreme 
power to set man in his place after so much pain and war? 

         They are everywhere...everywhere...hidden in our minds 
corner, reading our thoughts, our dreams. Locked away behind 
walls of steel and concrete, waiting to  escape in the eyes of 
revenge. Standing in the shadows with the darkness at their 
call. Juggling the flames of hatred on their fingertips, 
teasing the bite of the cold on a whim. And watching our 
skies...waiting...for what we have done is cold, it is 
anger...it is wrong. 

         The year is 2022...and things are far from any dream 
that our people could have had. Evolution has taking its power 
over us. Nature has found its curse on the normal humans of the 
world, and done so with the mutation of the man. 
          Welcome to our world....mutant.

Description :

The Imperial Strike Cruiser Retribution has been pulled out of
hyperspace whilst in transit. Heavily damaged, it now finds itself
stranded in orbit around Tatooine, in the depths of the Outer Rim
Territories. Other ships are similarly affected, and though not all
are damaged, a space anomaly has taken away one of Tatooine's last
redeeming features: You could always leave it.

Now, navigation computers aren't working right. The jump to 
lightspeed can't be made. Every day, new arrivals crowd this 
lifeless planet, and with an ever-dwindling stock of supplies, 
tensions are rising. Smuggling operations have been shut down by 
it, and the crime syndicates aren't happy. Suddenly, moisture 
farming looks like a viable career. Even the Empire is trapped in 
the system, and there's little chance of any reinforcements coming
to such a remote planet.

Even so, word of the Empire's defeat at the Battle of Yavin has 
made it to the planet, amid rumours the rebellion could be here. 
As people sell their most prized possessions for their next meal, 
rival gangs clash, and tensions mount. In this one system, 
victory could cause a morale rise that would affect the civil war
throughout the galaxy...

Description :

 The tall Silvery Blue figure watched silently as the orb
depicted the growing alliance between the Orcs and the Human 
races. Befuddled by this unlikely covenant he racked his brain
for some way to ensure that this would not come to fruition.
The Drake continent would surely never be able to withstand an
assault from both these races. His thoughts turned to the Evil
One who had been banished so long ago. A shiver ran down his
spine. Was Mordenaire even alive? Would unleashing the Pattern
Reave be the Drake's salvation or their epitaph? Behemut needed
time to ponder all these things. Time he didn't have. Time he
needed to bolster his dwindling Drake population. The great one
lifted his head and once again took slowly to the sky. For now
he would continue to grant his gift to the few deserving heroes
he could find. Perhaps if he could find enough of them, he could
forget the Reave altogether.

He let loose a gutteral bugle and in a blink was gone...

Description :

    If you are tired of each 'new' MUD being the same as all the others, 
Geas is the mud for you. Geas is unique, not a standard mudlib. There are 
NO stock areas, no levels, no classes. There are no 'global shouts.'

    Geas features a 100% original world with a rich, detailed background. 
Races are truly different, in stats and appearances, in their history, 
traditions, and the reactions of other people. Geas boasts a fully formed 
pantheon of gods, each with their own aspects, powers, and relationships. 

    In many MUDs, advancement is limited solely to monster killing. Not so
in Geas, which features a realistic learning-by-doing skill system. Players
improve the stats and skills they use - no fighting trolls to improve int.
A player can focus on the fighting skills of a warrior, the sneakiness of 
a thief, or the craftsmanship of a master smith. Four kinds of guilds are 
available: professional, layman, race, and craft, and a player may join one
of each type - or choose to go it alone.

    When it comes to fighting, Geas offers a realistic combat system, 
involving much more than just sitting back and watching hits scroll by. 
Players take an active part in fighting through a variety of specials. 
Armours are layered and crafted to protect specific body parts, while
weapons have different capabilities, depending on weapon and armour type.
Oftentimes in combat, strategy is the difference between life and death.

    The world of Geas has been more than three years in the making before
being offered to the general public, and it is anything but static. It is
growing and changing through a staff of active and knowledgable wizards,
with help and ideas gladly accepted from players as well. To learn more,
come in and try it out for yourself. A whole world is waiting for you.

have once again receded into history. It has been twenty years since the

to rage. For years, many have died on both sides, but no headway was made.
Until Now.

The Rebel Alliance has regained the capital planet of Coruscant. Once
again, there is a Republic on Coruscant. Now the battle is to keep it.
The Empire is far from diminished, but now fighting harder than ever
to convert the Galaxy to it's way of life. Relocated to Abyss, the 
new Emperor plots his revenge.

The Sith and the Jedi are still locked in mortal combat; for now
there seems to be balance, but it could change at any time.

It is still a time of turmoil and strife, where powers change each day.
Be careful with who you align, for you may make the differance.

Welcome To a Rebellion in the Stars,

We are a unique mud and have a lot of potential, but we need more players for 
that potential to be realized. Come check us out, and you might find that we 
are actually a good mud to stick with.

Description :

  The war between the immortals officially ended six hundred
years ago with the death of the lycan chieftan, Lucian. However,
the vampires and lycans continued to be blood enemies, hunting
and slaying each other brutally. As the twenty-first century
opened, these battles began to spill over into public, taking
human casualties on a regular basis, and coming dangerously close
to revealing the existance of both species.

  When a lycan plot is uncovered by the vampire death walker,
Selene, chaos ensues, and it's discovered that Lucian never
really died. No, he's been amassing his army of lycans in the
sewers beneath the city. When the conflict rises to a pitch,
betrayal and dishonesty is found at the very heart of the vampire
coven, and when the smoke clears, two of the three vampire elders
have been slain.

  Now comes an era of confusion for the vampires. The third and
final vampire elder, Marcus, has yet to awaken from his two
hundred year slumber, and the one who had been leading them in an
elder's abscence, Kraven, was revealed to be a traitor. Who will
ensure the continued survival of the vampires and lead them
against the lycans? Perhaps you will play a key role in a war
that has been raging for a millenium.

Join us, and find out.

  The street calls your name. Power comes for you, if you have the drive to
seek it out. Fame awaits you, if you have the skill to take it from others.
The Gods have left the world in chaos, and people live by taking life from
others. Run fast, die hard, and watch your back because few others will.
 
Seven classes and numerous races. Old areas await new exploration, and new
areas wait to test your wits and skill. Find your clan and defend it unto
death. Then, once you've made a name for yourself, ascend beyond normal
mortality and become a fighting immortal. These mortals are granted limited
powers and may be challenged by any hero who wants to try his (or her) hand.
Many quests await you, both immortal and autoquestor. Points gathered
from each are exclusive to the other and are used to purchase different
items.
 
When night falls, will you be the hunter or the hunted? When the sun rises,
will you be standing on your feet or lying in a shallow grave? Above all,
can you rise above the bloodshed to become the best of the best, the
greatest of the great? Or will you fall to your weakness, never to find
glory?

Deadly Temptation awaits, if you have the courage to find the answer..

Description :

A wind rises in the Mountains of Mist, sweeping down through the streets
of Caemlyn, circling around the straightlaced avenues of Cairhien, swirling
about the mountains a wary man calls The Dragonwall. It was not the 
beginning. There are no beginnings nor endings in the Wheel of Time. But 
it was _a_ beginning.

Storms invade the countryside, striking all at once. Rains of fire strike 
the lands, burning and killing dozens, if not hundreds caught in the path. 
The Aes Sedai are scrambling, some whispering that the Last Battle is nigh, 
for a major sign of the Prophecies of the Dragon have come about, and surely
that means he is reborn. Nations are unsettled, leadership is unsteady. 
Turmoil strikes the lands.

Cuendillar is set in a mirror world, as established by Jordan in his works,
where the events of the novels have not come to pass in exactly the same
manner. The world sets forth towards its own destination, striking its own
path along the way. Characters from the novels will not be present, but 
the game offers many of the same character types one would find in the
books. 

Cuendillar is operated with the permission of Robert Jordan. All players
are required to read: NEWS PERMISSION when they log into the game.

The world is full of history and places to visit, with fifteen current
cities and 11 nationalities to choose from. Character creation is
simple, and we are newbie accessible with a channel that can be used
for help even in creation (When connected, type "New [message]" to
communicate with other players). Both players and staff are
knowledgeable and willing to help new players settle into the world.

 The world is easily huge by just counting confines of city limits,
but a giant world map complete with more than five types of effective
terrains and intercity carriages between some cities make the world
simply staggering in size.

 Isle of Shadows is an adult-oriented, BDSM themed mush. 
The setting is based on islands with different features and
themes. There is built-in code for listing kinks, and a
customised description tool written specifically for us.

Shadows has been up and running since 1997, and has recently
changed staff, and code base. We are now running on MUX with
staff that have all been on Shadows since 1997.

Registration is open, but for your new character to play, you
must consent to the terms of service (which basically says
that you will see adult content, and accept that), and submit
your full name and date of birth. Any players that we learn
are not over 18 years old will be banned and deleted.

RP is allowed, but there is no set RP structure in place. Most
people treat this as a social place where they can feel free
to talk about their sexuality, even if it is far from the
mainstream, and connect with others that are like-minded.

Description :

   Azereth is a backwater land where petty rulers
rule only what they can control by force. It is said
that once long ago the whole land was controlled by
a mighty king,  you guessed it,  his name was
Azereth. The days of King Azereth are long gone,
civilization is only barely enforced in small towns
that dot the land,  and they  barely qualify.
Adventurers roam the land killing whatever they can
with wild abandon.  This is not all bad of course,
if you are the adventurous type who would like to gain
untold wealth and power without anyone even making
an attempt to stop them.  Of course to get there you
must be stronger than whoever has that wealth and
power, for this is an unforgiving land, and death
stalks everyone big and small, you can be the hunter
one minute and the hunted the next.next

Telnet      : slayer.kyndig.com 3500 [216.40.244.64]
WWW         : None
Description :

  Come mortal, don't be frightened, venture forth and accept
your new fate. Roam the lands of night, enter the plains of the
screaming; don't be afraid, embrace your new Destiny. You have
been chosen, offered the rare chance to glimpse the feuds between
the clans. You have been chosen to walk with the kindred, but are
you brave enough to enter the lair? Are you brave enough to live
in eternal night, to sacrifice daylight to forever become one of
Caine's childer?

  Vampire's Lair is a heavily modified Godwars based on the
World of Darkness. Classes available include vampires, ghouls,
the garou, and mortals. As we are set in the dark ages, there are
certain changes, such as Cappadocians instead of Giovanni, etc.
Our goal is to be the closest we can to the official books. If
you see a way we can improve and become closer without completely
screwing up gameplay, let us know.

  Two cavets before you enter the Lair. First, this is a
roleplaying mud. While we do have an arena where you can
challenge any player on whom you can see, if you prefer not to
roleplay when you're PKing and learning and so on, I suggest you
look at our sister mud, Dark City, at darkcity.godwars.net, port
3000. The second cavet is closely related. Classing certain
powerful vampiric clans and garou tribes involve an interview
with immortals who are knowledgable about them. If your heart's
desire is to embrace ultimate good/evil... just make sure you
know them, as the official books say, and you should EASILY be
able to pass our interviews. If the extent of your knowledge is
what you know from playing other muds, there are other
clans/tribes available that don't require the interviews.

Description :

  Dark Castle is an exciting and long standing MUD open
to players of all ages. DC boasts an active and free
thinking Immortal staff who rarely censor language,
violence, or actions.

With over 100 all-original areas Dark Castle MUD is a
challenge to both new and experienced mudders alike.

Some of Dark Castle's more notable features include:
-A detailed and highly developed player-run clan system.
 (Choose from both roleplaying and non-roleplaying clans!)
-A 'Meta-Physician' where stats are purchased...at a price.
-A vast array of items, mobs, zones, and storylines.
-A good but not excessive variety of races and classes.
 (Some classes include: Monk, Bard, Druid, & Anti-Paladin)
-Both Immortal and Game generated Quests.
-Some of the most detailed mob AI available.

Players new to mudding should certainly feel free to seek
an Immortal for advice as not all of Dark Castle's denizens
work for the 'good-guys'.

The game itself has been completely revamped within the
last year and is fully operational on fresh playerfiles
as of June 1, 2004. With improved coding and balance, and
an exciting new quest system, Dark Castle is back and
better than ever!

WWW         : http://members.cox.net/thedragonball/
Description :

 The Dragonball is very small with only a small starting area
for players to interact though we continue to grow everyday.

Unlike most dragonball themed muds, here you do not gain
powerlevel just by hitting an opponent, instead your
powerlevel increases along side your skills and experience.

We have all of the standard races installed and are 
currently working on majins and kais. We currently offer 
spaceships, both as preset transports and also personal 
ships that players may purchase to travel around the galaxy.

Here skills do not increase through use like the typical
smaug mud, instead you must study a skill to increase its
level. Also, as your skills level increases, it has a chance
to evolve into a more powerful skill.

There are many more features but to find those out you must
find out for yourself.

Hello there wanderer and adventurer of worlds.  

If your here, then your likely looking for a new mud to play on. 
Well look no further, you may have found what your seeking, and an
unexpected find it is at that.  

SoulMUD offers ample character advancement.
-4 Character Difficulties (Life Based Permadeath or No-Permadeath)
-6 Mortal Classes
-20 Avatar classes
-Single, Dual, Triple and Quad Classing. 
-12000+ rooms (140+ operational zones).

equipment without the hassle of returning to your corpse, or 
spirit talk to communicate while dead.  A fully customizable 
color configuration is available, as well as a variety of prompts.
The entire guild system revolves around characters levels, equip-
ment levels, and a complete skill-autogain system in all of the
abilities.  There are even skills such as forge, brew, inscribe 
and jewelcraft to create your own (though often higher level) 
items.   Guildmasters are known to imbue character objects while
leveling.  

An in-game event system, which is based upon time and cosmic forces
will run events upon a cosmic schedule, to offer quests and a change
of pace once every few hours.  Quests and Karma, wheee!   

Long term character play offering up to 320 character levels, and
feasably no 2 characters can ever end alike.  Due to difference in
character stats and equipment over time.  The web page does hold a
rough database of all abilities in game to help understand the 
system.  The web page also contains an equipment database, listing
all objects which load in game.

The world is not easy by any means, but what, if ever, is worth
while is ever easy.  It is not a simple mud, it is not an easy mud,
how ever it is a very Gud Mud.  

Those that do play enjoy it tremendously.

changes from other Dbx code bass muds that make sense. We
also keep the help files updated for newbies so they have
less reason to have to ask anyone anything unless that need
a further explaination.

  We care for our players, not only help them play, but we 
also make sure their characters are protected from those who
think hacking a mud is fun. I myself, will be coding in
alot more skills, i have plenty already coded that just

Description :

Elysium was founded on October 19th, 2002 by a group of
administrators from another MUD who wished to create a
place that was fun for both players and creators, without
the usual bickering and politics that run rampant in many
older, more established MUD's.  The founding members were
Renoir, Xelfer and Maledicta.  Several other creators soon
joined, and by the time Elysium was ready for the public
Blackthorne, Hobbes and Hare had all joined and made major
contributions.  Other wizards would soon follow, and we
hope that over time Elysium continues to grow and change
always following the vision of a politics free, purely fun
development and playing environment.

   Join us in the Elysium revolution!

Important Note: Elysium is open for players, however it is
under ongoing development.  That means that while the mud
itself is remarkably stable, there are some bugs still to
be sorted out.  We are growing fast and welcome new
players!

Mud         : Aeon MUD

Telnet      : aeonmud.tdf.ca 8000 [207.107.54.228]
WWW         : http://www.aeon.tdf.ca
Description :

 After five years in development, Aeonmud became an official project at the
end of 2001. Our staff have years of mudding and building experience and We
believe we are attuned to how mudders think.

 Aeon is still growing and expanding. It is a realm of many islands created
by the shattering of a magical sphere of the world and it will eventually
have an extensive ocean system to navigate. 

 We understand that many mudders still enjoy a bit of hack & slash, so we
cater to this by offering a wide variety of melee combat skills and spells.
However, we believe that the usual class constraints are fast becoming
outdated so we have introduced a profession inclination approach whereby
you can choose to have accelerated learning in your favourite collection of
skills (akin to the typical class approach).  The difference is that you
are free to learn any skill you choose, so warriors can learn magic,
clerics pickpocketing and mages combat skills!

 Trainers will soon be situated around the world.  You visit a trainer to
advance your theoretical knowledge of a given skill.  You gain practical
understanding of what you learn through doing, in this way we hope to make
the skill learning process rather more interactive and meaningful.

 Our areas are all original, with liberal use of detailed extra 
descriptions and many hidden surprises, including many automated quests.

Description :

  DragonBall Deliverance is a new-age Dragon Ball mud;
everything from the very start of your experience
at character-creation to when youre in the thick of
a battle with an opponent. At character creation you
pick your race (we offer 12 all with different 
abilities, strengths and weaknesses), then to make
it more personified you may pick your own personal
traits meaning no two people of the same race are
exactly alike. In gameplay progress is measured in
the how high you raise your skills and stats which
in turn determine your pl and overall fighting 
and performing ability. Each skill is customizable
based on how you the player trains that skill over
time your favorite attack might become faster or 
stronger and at a certain point of achievement will
be able to be given a name of your own. All in all
DB Deliverance is a game where the mudder can show 
his or her own personality based on how they train,
fight and perfect their character making it one that
is unique and personalized to their own picture of 
what a great being one can be.

WWW         : http://www.awake2062.net
Description :

  Awake 2062 is a Shadowrun-based MUD. It was originally 
based on Circle code, but has evolved extensively. Currently, 
we're moving towards full SR 3rd edition compliance. 
Awake 2062 supports all the major SR character types: 
deckers, riggers, shamen, mages, street samurai and 
physical adepts. We have a wide variety of both coded 
and roleplay-only abilities and skills as well. 
The MUD world is dynamic, detailed and constantly growing. 
There are a lot of areas to explore and roleplay in -
including the Sea-Tac area, Portland and parts of the
NAN. New places, etc. are perpetually being added. 

Awake 2062 is an RP-encouraged MUD, and gives its
players many ways to customize their characters and
their items - whether via detailed description commands
or the restring command. Though there are many autoquests
available, we encourage and reward good roleplay - whether
with karma, money or even special items/abilities. Both
players and immortal quest staffers run all kinds of rp
events, ranging from simple fights or short encounters 
to huge, world-changing epic runs.

Awake 2062 is a beta MUD, and much needs to be done to
fill it out and bring it into full 3rd edition compliance. 
But it's a great place in a constant state of development,
one which tries hard to stay true to SR 3rd-ed. in look,
feel, game mechanics and spirit.

Description :

    The Eye of Heaven is in shadow. Deep within the tunnels of
an interdimensional cyst, the ancient city of the Mote teems 
with the refugees and misfortunates from countless worlds. 
They have been trapped by the portals that lead down into the 
darkness, and their lives are commonly brief and cruelly 
ended.

     But not all are meant for victimhood at the hands of 
slavers or savage tribesmen. Some have a spark of promise 
beyond common measure, and the boldness and strength of will 
to make a better life in the darkness of the Mote. Some are 
trapped castaways or refugees from other worlds. Others are 
natives of the Mote with an uncommon drive.

     Players take the roles of these exceptional figures, each 
seeking to make what life they would in the shadows of the 
tunnels. Whether seeking wealth and glory in the ruins and 
hidden lairs that surround the Mote, simply trying to survive 
their neighbors, or even venturing to find a way to escape the 
House of the Eye, their lives promise to be interesting- if 
perhaps short.

     Interested players can even arrange to run their own 
campaigns set in the worlds that lead to the Mote. A vast 
selection of classes and races are permitted for play, and 
within the scope of your own campaign you're welcome to set 
your own game rules. The game uses the Open Gaming License 
provided by Wizards of the Coast, and we gladly invite others 
to come join the fun.

WWW         : None
Description :

  We begin in the midst of an impending crisis. The decadent
tamperings of a previous age had resulted in the greatest
slaughter in recent memory, and had changed a once trusted
people, the Realians, into objects of fear and resentment. Yet
humanity was given no room to contemplate this stunning reversal:
marketing, the mass love affair with modernity, quickly stepped
in to blot out the past. The latest blaze of neon geometry swept
the dirtier dealings from the stage. For a moment, it was
business as usual.

  But the forces put in motion by the Miltian Conflict, and
events long before it, were never addressed. Something far more
dangerous than a decay of Federation credibility had brought
itself to bear: the Gnosis. Reports of their large-scale
organization and horrifying attacks have been intercepted and
suppressed by the authorities as best as is possible, and not
entirely without success. Soon, however, humanity will come face
to face with the extent of its self-destructive tendencies.

May there be a deity to help them when that time comes.

Description :

  A world torn by strife and assailed by darkness...  A kingdom cut from the
wilderness and forged on the anvil of war...  Perched precariously upon the
brink of oblivion or glory... Who will tilt the balance?

In the southern forest of Gormengil, the drow are reunited beneath a vampire
king. Thirsting for vengeance over lands reclaimed from them by Grand Druid
Round and settled by the wood-elves and folk of the Ygwynean Forest, they
harry the borders, growing bolder with each passing day.

In the harsh but mineral-rich mountains of the north, the border lords face
the might of the denizens of Yrskalion, the Goblin Tower. Lured by untold
riches of the Silver Lords, the Orcish warbands from the length and breadth
of the Crolian mountains rally beneath the banner of the Firvulag horde.

In the west, the city of Crimson stands in palatial splendour, protected by
The Knights of the Crimson Rose, its traditional defenders. But evil lurks
within, sowing seeds of death and corruption and rotting the heart of the
rose, until its thorns drip with deadly poison.

The fate of a kingdom and the destiny of a people hang in the balance. It is
a time where they may be settled either at the hands of the brave, or seized
by the quick and ruthless. A growing evil encroaches upon the land, guided
by a sinister hand...  Who will defy it?  Who will embrace it?

Are you prepared for the challenge?

  CaveMUSH is a mush in the grand tradition of social-building-coding mushes.
The main body of the MUSH lay underground, but that need not limit its
content to only subterrainian venues.  Links to the Modern, above-ground
world do exist.  The story below ground deals with a race of small peoples
known as 'Gnomes,' for lack of a better term, (they are different than the
small, docile creatures of which you may have heard) and their struggle
against an oppressive race of snake-men known as Syphians, who also
live underground.  At this point in Gnomish history, contact with humanity
is limited, with only a few humans knowing of the Gnomish world, but with
most Gnomes knowing of the human world, but hiding because of their past
together (ancient humans initially drove them underground).  As a human
entering the Gnomish world, you will discover the Gnomes way of life, and
perhaps help them win an epic struggle against the Syphians, their greatest
foe.  Player building and coding is highly encouraged.  There is no quota
and no building limits.  Friendly people.  The core's the limit

  Mayhem is staffed by a small group of friendly immortals, not quite newbie
friendly, but we accept all players of experience, and will help where we
can. The mud is PK(player killing) based, so there isn’t much role playing,

you might just find immortals playing along.

  Here at Mayhem we have two tiers, each with 101 levels, hero being the
Highest you can go, and free killing within 10 levels, after level 20. We have
Installed a new player protection, which limits any player not in a clan, and
Under five hours, to not be attacked, or attack outside the arena.

  We have 20 classes to select from, 10 for first tier, and 10 more for second.
These are ranged from Mage to Assassin, Shaman to Thief. As well as with many
classes we also have a wide range of races, all of which are selectable for
both tiers, containing more than 20 total races, Mayhem has an Evolution system
set up for races, As you level you have the chance you become a better race if
the set requirements are met, and your chance roll passes.

  We also have a quest system, and a double quest point toggle, along with double
experience, so when doing a quest from the Quest Master, You can get double the
prize if it is turned on. One of the cool features is the Multi-Tiered quest item
system, We have different grades of Quest Items, From Normal to Elite, along with
Weapons, and Scrolls that you can buy and study for a permanent spell you can use
later on.

  Clans are already in game, and a few have already began to start, and are going quite
strong. Other clans have the chance to enter the other halls via clan hall entrances 
guarded by many Mobiles, that have to be slain before receiving the keys you need to gain entrance.

Within the clan hall you will be able to buy their Equipment, Potions, Weapons, and other
things that clan may have bought. 

Join us if you have the courage to survive the onslaught of ruthless Player Killers that
inhabit our realm. You could be the newest champion or the newest corpse by the roadside.

Description :

Harry Potter: Alere Flammas MUSH picked up the story of Harry Potter 
where _Goblet of Fire_ left off.

With Voldemort once more defeated, the wizarding world now tries to
put itself back together without the constant threat of You Know Who
to keep people looking over their shoulders.  The scene of his demise,
Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, is perhaps more and yet less
affected by the events which took place there.  The students have
a new confidence: not only did they beat back the worst threat to the
Wizarding World in nearly twenty years, but they did it with only the
help of each other and their teachers.

But the Ministry is looking to redeem itself, and with Lucius Malfoy
about to be inaugurated into the position of Minister of Magic, it's
not clear what form that redemption might take.

Feature Characters are available.  Open areas currently
include Hogwarts School, Hogsmeade, and London (Muggle and
Wizarding). Based on the books by J.K. Rowling.

Description :

   Play a part in the epic struggle of the Firan people against invading
armies, meddling Gods, and the internal enemies that Fate has pit against
them. Set in the capital city of Anarinuell, characters are a product of a
rich heritage in which a divine wager and an historic marriage plunged the
world into a war that has consumed three generations -- creating heroes,
villains, and victims.  Characters also share in common a large and
powerful city of residence; a charismatic leader; and a common enemy.  But
Anarinuell is not a city about sameness, and roleplay focuses upon
dramatic interactions among characters from different clans and different
social strata with widely divergent religious and political views.

   Firan's coded systems are designed to exploit these differences --
allowing social, economic, and physical combat. Enhance your reputation in
the community by earning social points.  Use those social points to spy,
to call upon favors, to supress witnesses against you or to sabotage
another person's reputation. Use your economic skills to negotiate better
prices, or to deplete the city's supply of a given resource -- driving up
the market, or instigating riots and strikes! In physical combat you can
pummel a foe with your fists, or run him through with your sword.  You can
even bring your assailant to justice with the legal system.  Come be a
part of the myth-making on Firan!

player killing is allowed if it fits within the rules and has strong
role play behind it. Please be sure to read over the rules before
playing, its a short list and mostly common since.

Times are rough in Tirradyn, the god wars are over or are they?
Mortals live their lives in fear of the 'dark races' but are they all
truly evil? Kedanna as returned to her realm, was it to aid the
mortal races or help the dark ones? Reports of strange tentacle
monsters run though the cities but they can't be true, can they?
Vast lands await those brave enough to go find them, and those strong
enough to make it out alive to tell the tail.

What is to become of the land known as Tirradyn? When the gods and
goddess gather, who truly wins? Will mortals always have sex in the
public eye? When will the dark races be stopped? Will they be
stopped? Will the fallen gods ever rule again? All those and more
depend on you and what you do. Are you up for the task, or will you
walk away from the passing sands of time? Will you be the hero of
songs, or the pouch line of jokes? Enter the Gathering and find out!

stages. Recently breaking into beta, we have been
progressing in huge strides towards a fully developed and
unique MUD.

of both worlds - Impressive potential for development, vividly
detailed areas and a deep immersive background story for each
area.

We believe that a friendly community is an essential 
point to having a successful MUD.

We now have over 20 active creators currently working
on over four large scale areas to add to our already
impressive assortment of areas. Rich vivid descriptions
and a very solid-themed base will make this an experience

Hellmouth: The New Chronicles
The peaceful quiet town of Pine Hills, Massachusetts. Far enough from
the noise and confusion of such cities as Boston, and Worcester.
Close enough to the Berkshire Mountains, and the border to New York
State. The winter's are beautiful, with snow covering the pines.
Spring bringing in fresh air and the re-awakening of nature. Summer,
with it's warm, humid days and moderate nights, allowing many of it's
inhabitants to enjoy it. And Fall, possibly the most picturesque
season of all. Autumn brings the turning of the leaves, and the whole
town's canvas is colored in subtle browns, oranges, yellows, and
reds. Children's thoughts turn to the return of school, while adults
prepare for the rapidly approaching holidays.

Or so the surface appears. Deep, underneath the surface, a convergence
of energies swirls, ebbing and flowing, yearning ever-constantly to be
opened. A Hellmouth. A gateway to another dimension where demons,
vampires, and other nefarious supernatural beings reside. They once
walked the Earth, but soon were replaced by man. They resent this, and
vow to once again receive purchase to that which was originally
theirs, and once more, bring Hell upon the Earth.

- OOC -
Finally the day has come, the opening of Hellmouth: New Chronicles!
After much revamping, recoding, and reworking the game is better than
ever, and the staff are opening the gates of CG for new characters of
all kinds. Got an idea, we WANT to hear it, and even more
importantly, we WANT to approve it! We'll work with anyone or any idea
as best we possibly can. Just log on and head in CG, and if you have
any questions, don't be afraid to ask.

Description :

 Nine months ago to the day, our mayor suddenly ceased to exist.
It is not a pleasant tale, but I will tell you anyway. He was
in the city of New Thalos, which was large and prosperous,
with its city guard, numerous guilds, and plentiful shops, when
the Darkness struck the city with a startling quickness. It
overran the city walls first, devouring everything in its
path. Next, it creeped slowly to the heart of New Thalos.
While it couldn't have taken more than 5 minutes, it seemed
like an eternity to me. Our mayor was there, perhaps on some
form of political business, and he vanished when the city was
reduced to nothingness. From that time on, our city has been
ruled by the Elders. They were either granted or born with
superb magical powers, granting them the ability to defend
Kieron with their lives, if it came to it. Each of the Elders
holds a respectable amount of social status, as well as a
good deal of influence over those residing in Kieron. Treat
them well.

WWW         : http://augustus.scs.uiuc.edu/~mud/
Description :

  Formerly called QuarantineMud, Chronicles is set in a mostly
unique mixed fantasy world. Players wrestle with powerful
monsters in efforts to gain vast treasures, search for rare
artifacts hidden throughout the world, and rise in level.

  Creating a character in this world involves a sequence where
the player is asked to assign 7 dice rolls to six player
statistics and then use 'stat points' to increase some of the
stats as desired. Stats can also easily be upgraded later using
points accumulated by questing, hunting artifacts, and levelling.

  Damage capacity, magic, and movement, are determined by a set
formula, so having or not having a certain stat at level up does
not permanently impact the player.

  Player killing is limited to 'outlaw players', and pk corpse
looting is limited to two items. Additionally. Town receptionists
sell corpse retrievals at a price based on number of deaths,
and death traps do not destroy equipment but send players to a
maze called 'Hell'.

  Alternative advancement (altadv) allows high-level characters
to continue to gain experience and divert it away from levelling
and towards obtaining points for use in purchasing more powerful 
skills for their character.

Description :

  The year is 2117, three and a half years after the beginning
of what would be known as the Maverick Wars. Three Riots, led by
the ex-Maverick Hunter commander, Sigma, have devastated many
parts of the world. Six months ago, Sigma's trickery caused the
decimation of the Repliforce, a worldwide peacekeeping
organization. Now, in 2117, the Mavericks have conquered the
continent of Africa, and are using it to push into the rest of
Eurasia. The Maverick Hunters, led by the fledgling commander
Signas and sanctioned by the world's government, the United Earth
Federation, is working with Nathan Kitford, UEF Chairman, to
combat the Maverick threat before it encroaches further than it
has been.

  Megaman X MUSH takes the basic wartime premise of the Megaman
X video game genre and flavors it with character information,
sources, and background from the Rockman X manga. Rockman X video
game sourcebooks, and Megamissions card series. The MUSH
encompasses all of these elements into a cohesive, immersive
anime-stylized theme of the war beginning to cover the world.

  Many characters are available for application from a variety
of sources: Game-Based Characters (GBCs), such as X, Zero and
Alia; Manga-Based Characters (MBCs), characters featured heavily
in the Rockman X manga, such as iX and Merti; and Card-Based
Characters (CBCs), characters featured in the MEgamissions card
series, such as Luxione or Curtiss. All of the GBC Mavericks have
been, as a note, revived and given their Limited or Hyperlimited
forms; additionally, characters not shown as Limited or
Hyperlimited, such as Vile and Byte, have also been revived and
upgraded. We also offer Admin-Created Characters (ACCs), made to
fill niches in the MUSH, such as Nathan Kitford, Jeanne Francaix,
or Wakano Yuuki.

Humans have branched off into multiple species that to some are

themselves out of fear of persecution and prejudice.

Xavier's School for The Gifted is known as a very selective school
for those who show special 'talents', but that's its public face.

Things dwell in secret that the world is unaware of- demons
and vampires skulk in shadow, walking in the darkness of night,
Trained magic users also walk the streets among those who
would  have them lynched if they knew their secret.
With demons, mutants, vampires and mages sharing the Earth with
humans...who really is the dominant species?

At Legacy of Evolution, players can select different kinds of
characters:
Feature Characters from the X-Men: Evolution series or Original
Characters that can include vampires, demons and mages
(Who have an Xavier-ish school in their own realm),even humans.
We encourage exploration and interaction.

Teams include the X-Men (only open to FCs at the moment),and the
New Mutants, Acolytes, Brotherhood and Morlocks (open to OCs)
or create your own team of heroes or vagrants!

your clothing. Once you are described, you can apply for a job (or ask one
of the wizards) and they will check your descriptions and change your colors
(colors will represent your class). From there you can enter the world of
CastleMOO and begin to rp. Our class system is royalty (King & Queen,
Princes & Princess, and dukes, barons etc..), clergy, merchants,
serfs/peasants/lowlifes and then all other jobs that don't fit in to those
categories. However, if rp isn't your thing, you are not pressured to do so.
You can also socialize with other people on the MOO who choose not to rp too.

 A lot of you may or may not know that the DBSaga codebase was
leaked. I happened to get a copy and decided to start a
better, more friendly MUD with some friends of mine. Before I
go into detail about what I have planned, I just would like to
personally thank Warren (Saga's Goku) for all his hard work
he's done for Saga, as well as the other coders.

DragonBall Infinity is a MUD based on the DragonBall/DragonBall 
Z/DragonBall GT anime and manga 
universe. Created originally by Akira Toriyama as a manga, 
it's spread into a TV series and movies. DBI is based on his 
work and gives a long list of things you can do.

With a list of races to choose from, we have everyone's
favourite the Saiyan, as well as Halfbreed, Bio-Android,
Human, Icer, Namek, Android, and Ghetti, more are in the works
for completion. A vast list of skills allows for every player 
to experience the power of firing the Kamehameha wave, or even
the planet destroying Death Ball attack.

Roleplaying is strongly encouraged with rewards as high as 
powerlevel increases and even getting the very rare items in 
the game. This hopefully will draw some of the BEST DBZ RPers 
to DBI and hopefully bring us to the top of DBZ RP. 

So come visit anytime, we're VERY newbie friendly and our 
Immortal staff is very helpful and can always use an increase.
Hope to see you there! :D

 The year is 2380.  Five years since the end of the Dominion War,
which devastated a large portion of Starfleet's Fleet, and
barely almost a year since the Romulans opened  negotiations.
But there are still challenges to be faced, and as much as it
looks like things are finally changing for the better there is
always that chance that something unexpected may happen. Knowing
this chance existed, in 2376 the Federation Council, based on
the presentation of Starfleet Command, authorized the
'Redemption Project'.  Sovereign-E-class starships were designed
to be heavier variants of the Sovereign-class starships.  To
start, Starfleet Corps of Engineers took the design of the
Sovereign and expanded on it.  Twelve new decks were added to
the design specs.  A new warp drive was commissioned to be built
by venerable earth-based General Electric.  In addition, a whole
new platform of equipment was to be designed for ship, with the
hopes that she would become the most sophisticated ship of her
kind.
 
 Right now, the ship remains drydocked, awaiting the rest of her
crew assignments, but one thing is certain.  This new ship will
be put to the test over time, and she's sure to prove her worth
to Starfleet.

  The Cold Flame of Dimensia is set after the Last War, when war
has become a rarity, and skirmishes barely more common. But the
world is changing, fears of greater evils rising spread across
the planes of Ishaetal, sending scholars to their libraries to
examine the histories most have tried to forget. The high
council's begged their warlocks and runelords to put a Rune of
Creation deep into the surface of the earth, to call forth worthy
heroes to fight their cause.

  You, yes you, are one called forth by the power of the Rune,
come, and offer your help to fight for the people of Dimensia.

--

  Dimensia is a highly modified CircleMUD, that hopes to
offer a great variety in play to encourage much more varied
character expansion. We are quite newly opened as of December 2004,
so do not expect a huge playerbase right now, please play the game
for its worth, not for the number of other people already there.  So
come now, and live our world, then make it yours!

Description :

 It has been twenty-three years since the Rebel Alliance, with
the help of many heroic men and women, were able to destroy the
first Deathstar at the Battle of Yavin. Since then, the galaxy
has seen much. The Republic has been reborn from the old Rebel
Alliance and now operates from the grand cityscape of Coruscant.
Luke Skywalker has begun a new Jedi Order and established the
Jedi Academy in an ancient Sith temple on Yavin IV. There have
been several incarnations of the old Galactic Empire, one of
which destroyed several planets including Byss, although, most of
the Imperial Remnant has been dead for a decade now. Peace has
been experienced in increasingly larger portions lately, which
for a generation of war-hardened people is an ill omen. It is
also a time of rebirth for the Force, pumping out more than
the normal amount of Force-sensitive beings, as it is recovering
from the Great Jedi Purge lead by the Galactic Empire and
Darth Vader half a century earlier. In time it will balance
again, as it was in the era of the Old Republic. The Republic
continues to restore its old territories and forge new alliances
while the Jedi continue to search out and train the
Force-sensitive children, creating an all-new Jedi Order unlike
anything seen before. In Imperial space, however, a new threat is
spawning. Several of the leading Imperials are planning their
plot to return the Empire to power under a new Emperor. A Dark
Jedi named Brakiss has constructed a Shadow Academy, under
Imperial instruction, in order to turn Jedis from the Light and
train them for the Dark Side. Will the new enemies prove too
strong for the Republic? Is there a more terrible force lurking
in the background? Only time will tell..

Description :

  The world called Earth is a very different place, now.
Thousands of years after atomic, genetic, and genocidal 
warfare tore the planet asunder, society has finally 
started the rebuilding process. Nothing, though, is as it 
once was. Strange mutant creatures, force-evolved from 
radioactive waste and the minds of geneticists, roam the 
land and fight for their very lives. Now more then ever, 
it's survival of the fittest.

It is a time of chaos, strife, and warfare as like-minded 
groups form 'clans' to wage their dominance over others, 
each claiming a section of the Earth to call their own. 
Similar genetic species begin breeding, and over the 
millennia, true races came into being quite unlike humans
had ever been. Villages and cities begin to spring up, the 
more aggressive surviving by conquering and pillaging the 
others.

The world is in anarchy and chaos, a time when a single 
shift of power could upset the delicate balance, cause 
another of the Shadow years. Old rules and icons are no 
more, old barriers broken, old values forgotten.

Now is the time of Iconoclasm.

WWW         : http://builderacademy.net/
Description :

   The most challenging aspect of running a mud is finding good builders. You
will hear this from the admin of every MUD that has ever been. In the past it 
has always been up to each individual MUD to find and usually train their own 
builders. This works, but I think the CircleMUD community can come up with 
something better. That is why I created The Builder's Academy.

   We have been open to anyone interested in learning or teaching how to build
using Oasis OLC with dg scripts since 2000. The current developer of DG scripts,
Welcor, uses The Builder's Academy (TBA) as the development port for DG scripts. 
Now TBA has expanded to also be used to develop stock zones for CircleMUD.

   TBA has trained over 1000 builders and has an extensive tutorial and help
file system. No pressure, no deadline, just come learn, teach, or help develop 
CircleMUD. Give back to the community we have all taken so much from. TBA is a 
CircleMUD resource. Take advantage of it so we can improve all of CircleMUD. 
TBA can also be used by other MUDs as a builder's port. Just send us your 
newbie builders. We will teach them and then you can have them back with the 
zones they built.

   We are always open to anyone willing to learn, teach, or help develop stock
CircleMUD,Oasis OLC, and DG scripts.

Repliforce (Led by General, a group of reploids who serves

Hunters (Led by Dr. Light and Rock (Megaman, X), an elite 
gathering of reploids that work outside of government 
regulations), The Mavericks (Led by Sigma, a group of 
reploids infected by the Maverick Virus, causing them to 
have an uncontrollable hate for mankind), and the Robot 
Masters (Led by Dr. Wily and Bass (Forte), a group of 
androids built by Dr. Wily, who is bent on world 
domination.). Along with these four factions, the fifth 
faction, the Civilians, consists of humans, androids, and 
reploids, with functions ranging from regular citizen, to 
Secretary-General of the UN, to a member of the Yakuza, to 
an elite Strider.

Description :

 AmalgaMUX is a place based on freedom of thought.
The freedom to act, think, roleplay, and just be as your heart suits you.
It is also based upon the freedom from being trounced upon by others.

Our roleplay system is based upon Cooperation between players, no matter what
sort of interaction takes place among characters. We do not have any combat
systems. All violent roleplay is handled on the basis of agreement between
the participant Players. Agreement is emphasised here, as disagreement causes
a whole lot of upset for everyone involved. We beleive it is nicer if everyone
involved, no matter how bloody the fray, are really working together on the
outside.

Our game is one that is open to peoples of all varieties
We make no record of the demographicality of our users in ANY WAY. We beleive
that it is the responsibility of the person to judge what is appropriate for
their situation, and we will have no part in 'Governing' people's behaviour.
It is up to the individual to choose what he/she/ono participates in. We make
no recording of what people do in private, that is not our business.

In short, we turn no-one away that does not turn others away.
If ever you have been turned away before, and you want to in friendship return,
you are most welcome here.

Our playing grid is admittedly lacking, but a construction
concept exists, although it needs more time from those involved
in its inception.

Description :

 The Marches of Antan, first established in 1990, continues 
to offer one the most intelligent, challenging, and 
enjoyable MUDs with a long and rich history. Loosely based 
on the literary works of James Branch Cabell, Antan allows 
players a variety of choices and lifestyles.  

One can join the Merchant's Guild and open their own pub or
shop.  Those who seek nobility can aspire to the Peerage
and a title and House.  Others might wish to join the
Architect's Guild and sell their designs to other players.
Others might remain a member of the Free Company of 
Adventurers or go freelance.  Anyone with the gold and 
inclination can purchase a home.  There is a role 
satisfying and suitable for every player's desire.

With custom skills, abilities, combat and magic systems, 
Antan has both a familiar feel and unique attraction. 
Skills, spells, and all levels of training are available to 
everyone, regardless of race or guild affiliation. 

Equipment can be kept by going to sleep instead of quitting.
Though Glaum, the Sylan-without-bones, might steal your
body if you opt to sleep outside of a dorm, apartment, or 
bedchamber.

With exceptional quests and a small, yet fun and loyal, 
playerbase, Marches of Antan is worth exploring.

Telnet      : promage.hopto.org 4000 [213.224.18.151]
WWW         : http://www.promage.be
Description :

Promage is a mud coded from scratch in Visual Basic.
We have rooms, monsters, objects, grouping, skills, damage and
healing spells, ansi color, auto-mapping, shops, mailing, storage,
banking, automated questing, training, 5 races and 7 classes.
In contrary to most muds, monsters and objects don't have fixed
stats, but the level determines the stats. This allows unique
abilities like leveling up objects and monsters.

Objects level up by simply wearing them and killing monsters equal
in power, making them stronger in defense, attack and/or damage.
They can load on monsters, in rooms and chests and can tweak or
have many different attributes. Tweaking means the object is either
slightly better of worse than normal, an iron sword +7 means
is 7% better. Attributes load at random, for example a chance to
pierce armor.

The mud is in testing phase because more coding is required to be
an complete mud, but everything will be treated as in a real
production, meaning no player deletion when we go fully operational.
Furthermore, dedicated testers will be compensated for their troubles.

 Want a MUCK where people actually get out, get IC, and RP on a regular basis
Want a MUCK with wizzes who're friendly, helpful, -and- connect regularly
so that you don't have to wait ages for a reply to a mail or for a request
to be processed? Then Sunrise is the place for you!

Sunrise was built to be a place that'd put a stop to the complaints like
'there are never any wizzes on' and 'It takes -ages- for my request to be
processed.' Its wizards and staffers are friendly and helpful, and, of
course, on often. Built -- literally, as the lands are all those of the
various prides and clans and packs of the MUCK-- by the players, Sunrise
has no canon characters-- that is, no living characters from TLK or TLK 2.
Instead, the MUCK centers on the lives of the aforementioned prides and
packs so that no-one's left trying to figure out how to fit into some
formulated plan everyone's seen played out a billion times. While the
wizzes are always ready to take suggestions for a MUCK-wide TP, such things
are left, largely, to the players to cook up.

In theme, Sunrise is an African-based non-human MUCK. All animals: birds,
mammals, reptiles, even bugs-- provided they're from Africa, naturally--
are welcome. Play an arrogant raven, a picky vulture, an owl, or a
loud-mouth parrot. Or, on the mammal front, there's the ever-popular lion:
the prides are always welcoming new members, and Sunrise has all kinds:
good, evil, and in-between! Then there's those hyenas, wild dogs, and
leopards. -- And that's not even getting into the primates, the prosimians
such as the galago, or the herbivores like the dik-dik, sable antelope, and
kudu. Certainly, there's a plethora of species to choose from, and plenty
of people who'll help you out if you're having a hard time choosing, as
well as requests for characters on the messageboards. So come to Sunrise
MUCK! You won't regret it.

Description :

     It is a land of promise... a land of intrigue, guile,
alliances and deceit. It is a land where wars are waged, diplomacy
sought. It is a land of fantasy, of magic and myth.

     It is called Mythara... but it once was called Earth. Mankind
ruined it, abandoned it, and after killing himself off, left it to
heal itself. Mankind has been neither seen nor heard in more
millennia than even the eldest of races can recall.

     Many would argue that this is a good thing.

-----

     Welcome to Mythara: Remnants of a Shattered World! We are a
semi-high fantasy MUX with a unique twist: the races you've come to
know and love in fantasy fiction are shockingly different, our own
legends mere shades of their reality. God-like beings walk the
planet, and interact on a personal basis with its inhabitants.
Mythological beasts roam the countryside unhindered... and the
ancient technologies of the destroyer race, mankind, are not only
forgotten, but also long gone to dust.

     Aside from the occasional political dispute, this world is
practically idyllic. Then mankind had to show up again, and mess
with everything. That was two years ago, with men and women from
our own time, preserved through time by a magic they had no
conception of, finding themselves in a world unlike their own. And,
unlike the stories from their past, this time they had no fallen
technology to reply upon.

     So, be a human, and help the struggling race climb from the
ashes... or, if it suits your tastes more, play as one of eleven
other player races in this dice-less, freeform role-play
environment. The story is yours to write.

     Our game is currently open for playtest and chargen. Don't
mind the dust, we're still moving in!

a feel similar to that of Toril or Sojourn, spell
interactions, and various other improvements that have
culminated in a nearly total re-write of the original code-

damage calculation that allows for resistances, 
immunities, vulnerabilities, and reversing of different 
types of damages based upon different attack and spell

Description :

 The wizards confronted Torban about his actions, but he
would not listen to their pleas. Torban soon disappeared
from view all together, to wait upon a time when he would
release the bonds he had placed on the mana sites.

That was more than 500 years ago. Since that time, the
races that had fled underground returned to the surface to
find a world changed beyond all recognition. And recently
people have discovered new ways to gain mana, and to work
their way around the blocks between worlds with word
controlled portals. A new age of magic is here.

The population of Delsance returned to the surface to find
their land all but destroyed by the furious wars. What had
once been a magnificent land, had been reduced to little
more than a desert. The only inhabitants of this area were
the nomadic Delsan, the only race that did not seek shelter
underground, with their caravans moving about scavenging
the desert slowly of its remaining resources. It is in this
desert that the great wizard Torban is rumoured to live, in
the last of the ancient mana towers, which is protected by
an oasis to confuse the wily explorers.

The people dispersed, to seek new homes. Most moved to an
area known as the Salyes Plains in the centre of the
continent, whilst others returned to the underground,
satisfied with their new home. These new kingdoms have
flourished in the five centuries since the mana was
blocked, and the way is open for bold young adventurers to
seek fame and glory on the new frontier...

Description :

Pokemon Neo MUCK is a roleplaying community based on the 
traditional Pokemon theme, with more emphasis on the games 
rather than the anime. Even though we do have anime FCs 
available. We've been around for about 5 years now, having 
branched off from the late PokeMUCK. Our wizards and staff 
are experienced, friendly, and knowledgable. Our playerbase
is small, but tight knit, and RP quality is high. We have
an elaborate world cut into three main sections; Kanto,
Johto and Hoenn with the Orre region intermixed with Hoenn.
We have all the latest species available, and many MANY 
FCs (Pokemon and Human alike) available for application.
Pokemon Neo is a Trainer's paradise, as we allow an 
unlimited number of Pokemon zombies, and the staff even 
hide them throughout the grid for people to find and RP 
with. Pokemon eggs can also be obtained from Pokemon 
breeders, and pokemon can be bred at those same facilities. 
Vendors are also available for the selling of TMs, Stones, 
and hold items. 
While we don't consider ourselves elitest, but there is 
an application process, to help weed out some of the 
not-so-good RPers. However, we are newbie friendly, and the 
staff will openly give suggestions and help to anyone who 
doesn't get their application approved the first time. 
To keep fairness on the MUCK, we do have suggestions for 
leveling and battling. As we find it chaotic and twinkish 
to have people level at their descretion, and have pokemon 
in the upper levels after only having them for a couple 
months. We don't have a 'true' battle system, but more of
a rudimentary one. We use dice and coin flip programs, 
and have a guide to the suggested level growth. We even 
have a Pokedex program that can tell you all a trainer 
needs to know about every pokemon species.

The theme would also be considered mostly PG-13, maybe R
at some points due to violence and some language. However,
there is generally no sexual activity.

So come check us out! You likely won't be disappointed.

Description :

  'Pick your enemies carefully or you'll never make it in Los
Angeles.'
         - Rona Barrett

  A House Divided is a MUSH based on Vampire: The Masquerade.
The setting is modern Los Angeles, a sprawling metropolis with
over 15 million mortals and scores of undead who hunt them. Upon
this canvass, our goal is to create the finest, most engaging and
politically complex Vampire MUSH in the world.

  'How are you different from the other White Wolf MUSHes on the
net?'
*   We focus *only* on the setting of Vampire: the 
    Masquerade; we don't even bother trying to fold in
    the other World of Darkness games.
*   We have a streamlined role-play system designed to
    take advantage of the MUSH environment. Everything
    you need to play is available online.
*   We have an extensive stat-locked lore system that
    provides ample surprises and mysteries for the most
    jaded of players.
*   We support cooperative RP - a philosophy that draws
    on the maturity of the players to provide realistic
    and player-driven role-play.
*   Any player can play _one_ neonate level vampire;
    it's a Vampire MUSH. Ghouls and mortals are more freely
    available. Older vampires are application-only.
*   Our focus is Camarilla society, with its politics and
    intrigue. While mortal society is present as a 
    backdrop, our MUSH revolves around vampires.

Bloody Nightmares first opened its doors in 2000 but due to unforeseen
circumstances closed its doors in early 2002. Three years on the light

There are 400 mortal levels with in the world. with the classes being
built around a tri-class system, for the first 300 levels with the 
final 100 level being the avatar levels.

Number races call the world home with 315 area to choose from in which
to level, these being mostly stock at present but will we overhauled 
in the coming months are we develop our continent system. 900 plus 
skills mean that each class has something different to offer.

Although we have the benefit of 2 years of coding and building before
the mud went down, the subsequent 3 years when the mud was down has 
meant the BN has lost many from its player and immortal base. This 
being so we are now on the hunt for mortals, ptesters, builders 
helpfile writers and anyone else who wants to help build a world to
enjoy.

The only condition to be an Immortal is that you must first make it to
level 50 and want to help out.

You can contact Cormac at cormacrulz@hotmail.com.


A basic BN forum can be found at bn.felstarweb.com/forum. its pretty 
basic atm but will expand as people share their ideas and blow mine 
out of the water :)

"The best way to predict the future is to invent it."

Ancient Chaos has sprung from minds and souls of many VERY
experienced and long time players of MUDs, particularly SMAUG muds. 

These people have joined to create an incredible world of conflict,
puzzling quests and groups of people that love to play in a fantasy
text-based world. 

We are new-player friendly as well as savvy in the wants and desires
of extremely experienced players. Our Immortals are approachable and
available to help you with your concerns and problems.

We have already created MANY new areas (and our staff is constantly
working at constructing new ones).  There are also many new features
in Ancient Chaos including a fully integrated marriage code system
that allows you to MUD marry and have a special command
called "Soulmate" to immediately transfer you to your mate wherever
they may be (except for a few limited places). 

Our Deity system is fully reworked and uses an extremely complicated
variable system which gives our many Deities unique and diverse
attributes.

We are currently still in the design stages, but open to the public,
so come and join a new MUD where your views, opinions and time can
actually make a difference to shape the path of our MUD.

We are currently TEMPORARILY offering a free advance to Avatar and a
full set of Avatar grade equipment and 20,000,000 gold coins to your
first character to be created on Ancient Chaos once it has achieved
level 20.

We allow infinite character creations and currently allow up to 8
peaceful characters per player (ip) to play simultaneously so that
you may help one character with others. Deadly (PKill or PVP) players
are limited to ONE DEADLY character per ip logged at any one time.

**************************************************
We are currently looking for builders who have vision and GOOD
knowledge of the spelling and grammar of the English language.
(Sowwy ... We dunt wunna rewright all your aryas no madder how
awesum yur dreems.)

Successful applicants will be able to create areas (using the SMAUG
codebase (and our custom builders' commands and variables as they
come along)) that will conform to the current balance and
mob/equipment limits which exist on the MUD at present. He or she
will be able to create areas within a bracketed level range and not
ONLY be interested in building Multi-Avatar level areas.

Applicants will be asked to level to level 20 in order to get to
become familiar with our MUD and its staff and players somewhat as
well as have time to check news, notes and help files. It does not
take a lot of work to accomplish this.

We are currently coding new custom building commands with extended
variables to make your every construction dream a consuming reality
for our players.

   More than five years have passed since the maniacle
scientist, Andross, was banished to Venom for his crimes
against the Lylat system. For a time, it seemed that
Corneria was safe from his crazed experiments in
bioweaponry. Reports of disturbing activities on Venom sent 
the Starfox team to investigate the possibility that 
Andross' twisted genius had resurfaced, sealing James 
McCloud's fate. Andross has sent his ultimatum to the 
citizens of Lylat: surrender, or be destroyed.

   Already, the simian's evil has spread across half of 
the Lylat system. Only the Corneria Military, with the 
assistance of rogue mercenary teams, such as the likes of 
the new Starfox, headed by Fox McCloud, can stop the 
madness of one ape from destroying all life in Lylat.

   Now you have the opportunity to play a role in the 
Lylat Wars. Will you join the Cornerian Military and fight 
for the preservation of Corneria, or swear fealty to 
Andross and seek to destroy all who oppose your master? A 
great chapter of Lylat's history is about to unfold, and 
your services could decide the outcome.

Description :

  Evil's Curse is a world where fallen Immortals have
taken control of parts of the realm in an attempt to
destroy what they cannot have.  It is a realm where
the choice of being good or evil is more than just an
alignment, but a choice to either stand against or
stand with the evil consuming the world.  Come, check
us out, and maybe find an adventure!

We are currently looking for builders and coders to help
us create what we hope will be an enjoyable experience.

Description :

 Note:  At Vilaross MUD, we strive to make it YOUR Mud. We want to 
have a fun environment where we hope you will return again and again.
We have a stable site and codebase, and have been running for 7 years. 
We won't go anywhere!  And we have a strict no-player-wipe policy.  So 
come in and carve out your own little slice of the world!

The Age of Redemption:
The world has been in turmoil.  The forces of the Chaos God, Entropy, 
invaded, laying waste to cities and civilization.  Order had been 
upended. The Gods of Vilaross, working through their followers, 
drove back the horrible forces of Chaos, and restored order, but 
the cost was high.  The great god Ryouga was feared lost, sacraficing 
himself to close the portal to the Chaos Realm, and his wife, 
Bellandra had been murdered. Valyn, God of Justice, had disappeared. 
Many of the other gods had also been slain.

A generation has passed since that time. Ryouga has returned, 
having slain Entropy and regaining his own immortality. He hopes to 
bring the world back to its peaceful self.  But, the god Santhos 
still lurks in the shadows, hoping to bring the world under his control.  
A new battle begins for the redemption of Vilaross. Who will rise as 
the new power in the world? The answer to that question is up to those 
who live in it.

universe of danger and adventure, where the forces of light
strive to battle the ever growing menace of a triad of despicable
foes. The Shadoen, merciless and ruthless servants of the Shadow
Lord. The Void, instruments of a mad God, and the Risen - Undead

Description :

   In the dead of the night, a dark shadow heads over the bridge
stopping at the centre, crouched, waiting. A blaze of hellfire
clears away on the opposite side, a demon stepping forth. In a
flash two sets of fangs blur into existence, an engagement,
vicious claws appear and a daggers clashes.

   A glimmer of light in the darkness creeps over the nearby
hill, and a creature of holiness comes into view, her eyes
shining, she blasts the combatants with divine fury. The demon,
enraged by the intrusion, returns a rain of fire, while the
vampire raises its shroud, and vanishes into nothing, promising
vengeance. 

  As deep rumbling sounds, the ground splits open, a huge
humanoid bursts free and demands silence for his slumber in the
earth. With a wave of his gigantic arms, it harnesses the powers
of the elements, bringing them down on the weakened creatures.
Retreating, bringing their quarrel elsewhere, and ending the
battle. Laying his massive form upon the ground the titan closes
his eyes for much wanted rest.

   A small shuffling in nearby bushes beside the stream produces
an Elven Ranger, a Dwarven Warlock, a Human Shaman, and a
Draconian Knight. Their eyes wide with awe at what they had
witnessed, carefully passing the massive form of the titan they
cross the bridge to the city of McGinteys Cove where they were
headed.

Description :

 The city of 'Straford' in 'the-night.com' is a hotbed of crime, mystery,
paranormal activity, and (best of all) role-playing.

Established in 1999, 'TNC' (formerly 'Stormy Nights') has a new owner and a new
direction. The game focuses more on non-stop player-instigated role-play
with staff assistance (and from time to time a staff-instigated role-playing
session). A player-run newspaper (complete with reports, editors, newsrooms,
bulletin boards, and, of course, newspapers) reports the activities of the
players, including the player-run police department and organization that
often conflicts with one of the player-run mafias. These run-ins often lead
to player lawyers representing both sides in our realistic courtroom design
with a concealed jury system.

With new professions being enhanced for player-run role-playing all the
time, 'the-night.com' is constantly improving itself. Currently featuring a 
real-time camera/film/theatre system, cars, houses, offices, postal system,
phones, casino, three towns (two habitable), television system, auction
system, player-run bars, airplanes, trains, musical instruments, accent
system, identity-concealing masks, access to staff assistance, and more!

Coming soon: player created (filmed, written, edited by and starring) films,
medical system (player-run hospital), and more!

'the-night.com' now supports the Wizard Front End client for those who
wish to use it. Access information can be found at www.the-night.com.

  Prodigy first went online under the name Parody in 1989
on the MirrorWorld/IOWA system in the UK. The game was
rewritten to be more flexible in 1990 and become Prodigy,
and ran until early 1993.

The setting is the mythical land of Wesarg, and draws
mostly from European mythology, with a dose of Pagan and
proto-Christian symbology.

Players may choose to be a Warrior, Mage, Rogue or Priest,
with this choice placing certain restrictions on their
combat and magical abilities, with some spells reserved
for certain classes. Various skills are also available to
all players.

Prodigy is all-original, written from scratch in StarLite,
a language that was written specifically for Prodigy. The
game is old, and offered up more as those who are curious
about how games used to look...

Greetings,

We would list some long lengthy post with an elaborate description of the 
theme's development, but we are not quite that far along.  We just started 
up not too long ago and are starting the development.  We are open to 
players and are working on building up our staff.  Even though it is a 
dystopian derivative, we don't tolerate rule breakers, abusive attitudes, or 
disrespect of the staff.  On the flip side, the staff shall not mess with 
the staff, abuse the players, or act unethically.  This does not mean that 
the staff will not enforce rules or react to someone who is antagonizing them.
If you have some spare time, and are looking for a fair place to play, 
swing on by.

Description :

  The world of Castle D'Image is a world in which intrigue
and romance, adventure and magick are commonplace. It is a
land of possibilities, where almost anything an and does
happen. For reference purposes, it can best be described
as falling roughly into a late medieval - early renaissance
timeframe. It is /not/ set on an historical earth,
or even an alternate history earth. The universe of CDI is
not the universe of earth, thus historical arguments will
not necessarily be given credence.

Applications are required for characters who are nonhuman,
magical, and/or of noble birth. All other characters can be
created and played immediately. The MUSH boasts 2-3 long
term, MUSHwide TPs per year, usually running 1-2 RL months
in length, with other player-run plots and day to day RP
occuring in between.

Description :

  Many millenniums ago, before man was born, dragons ruled this world and protected it 
under their mighty wings. Most dragons had a gentle nature and they were all very clever. 
The evil dragons kept to themselves far away from each other and other beings.

Then one year, after a bad harvest, an evil human man named Aqoidhac came to power by 
playing on men's superstition and claiming it was the dragons fault the weather had 
caused their harvest to falter. Many people gathered and wanted to see the dragons fall. 
A great army went out and challenged the dragons' fury. The battle between men and dragons 
lasted for years, but the human race had grown to be too formidable for the dragons to 
control, and after a decade of war, almost all the dragons were gone from the face of 
this earth.

Now they all live in fear for the next attack from the evil dragons. Some of the gentle 
dragons that survived aren't strong enough let alone enough to conquer the evil ones. The 
few people that today protect themselves and the earth from extinction call themselves The Last Defenders.

Location: Earth/Gaia/whatever you want to call it. Basically,
this is one planet in which the Final Fantasy games have
all taken place on. All characters have always been born of
this world, and only recently traveled to this part of the
world, for whatever reason. Series characters should always
keep their histories canonical up to the point they arrive.
Simply put, all areas on the grid take place in the same
world as the Final Fantasy games.
 
Currently there are two land masses accessible - others
will open up as the playerbase grows. Those two land
masses are New Xestia, the most technologically advanced
city on this area of the planet, and Senalia City, a place of
tolerance with a mix of magic and lower technology than
Holtz City, in New Xestia, possesses. The only way one
can get out of Senalia City is via the undersea train that
passes between Senalia and New Xestia.

Eternal Fantasy's timeline will be based pre-game

** Mud is NOT open for Player Testing Yet, we will make an
announcement when it's open ** Still hiring builders **

In the days of deep knowledge, Imlir, the eldest of all wizards,
unlocked the secret of the ley lines and created the first gate,
connecting one center of learning to the other by which all
could travel a great distance in a short time.  The Country of 
Arador prospered greatly, both in wealth and in knowledge, and 
became the great center where all nations gathered under a common 
bond.

When attacked from all sides by horrific invaders, Arador faced the 
difficult decision of whether to use the Imlir Gates in ways they 
weren't intended: to evacuate the populace of the country to 
safety.  The decision was made, and evacuation commenced. The gates 
themselves fell under the attack, and the magic of the Imlir gates 
surged in waves, and followed the ley lines to the other gates which 
responded likewise.  Imlir and the others struggled to control it, 
but the power increased exponentially, until a sudden clap of 
thunder sounded and a great flash, later reported seen by all towns 
and villages, burst forth.  Then darkness.

The records from the invaders indicated the lands of Arador vanished 
that night, and nothing could be found of it anywhere.  The land had 
changed, as if great portions had been scooped from their spots.  
The people of Arador would never know this.

How long the darkness lasted, none knew.  When it subsided, Imlir 
and many of the great mages were dead or had vanished, consumed by 
the great magics.  But that was not all which had changed.  The 
night sky showed vastly different stars, the climate had changed and 
later even the very geography was discovered altered.  Arador had 
been transported to a different place altogether, each town and 
village were separated and all the Imlir gates were destroyed.  Even 
the great centers of learning were not spared, for vast portions of 
knowledge were gone, even portions of the towns and villages were 
missing, as if they had never been.

Join us and Escape to Arador!

Description :

In the year 2050, a technological breakthrough was made
which enabled time travel to finally be accomplished.  With
this ability to travel backwards and forward in time it
allowed anyone and everyone the luxury of knowing what the
future would bring and what the past was.  However, this
luxury turned into the final breakdown of all societies.

With the multitude of people jumping through time and space
to undo wrongs of the past, and find out secrets of the
future, the past and the future became intertwined, confused,
and unstable.  From this abuse of physics the Nexus was
formed.  The Nexus was a terrible distortion in the fabric of
the space time continuum with infinite portals that lead to
every point in space and time.

Time travel was outlawed in the year 2099, but the Nexus
remains.  Here in the Third Millennium you will find what
remains today after the first 50 years of the new world.  The
question of race and class has been eliminated.  All men
and women are created equal.  We as individuals determine who
we are and what we do.

  Raughir is dead, and the Last Rift War is over. With the death of its Demonic
Emperor, the empire of Uruadum has disintegrated into civil war and chaos. But
from the ashes of defeat, the ancient city of Tenigul has arisen and asserted
its independence and dominance over the vast province of Akar.

It has been a difficult path to independence, however. Enemies on all sides
have beset the city and its province; old alliances have been broken and from
them have come new enmities. The collossal Durnalian Empire to the Northeast,
across the Kunyori Sea, has established trade with Tenigul, but there is often
a grave mistrust for the Durnalians; they were bitter enemies in the Last Rift
War. This is a delicate time for Tenigul, and its people. Many and varying
Factions within the city and without it are at constant odds with each other,
and at any moment an old rivalry may erupt into war. Such is the Kingdom of
Akar. These are days when friendships are made and broken overnight; when
personal gain is the primary loyalty of most men.

So what will your role be here, traveller? Will you profit greatly here, or
will you become the pawn of the powerful? Whom will you serve? Or will you
serve yourself? The decision is yours, but beware whom you befriend. Not all
is as it seems in the City of Tenigul.

Death's Domain has been around for over a decade.  

Death's domain offers a full multi-class system while still 
keeping the line between the classes.  The game is loaded with
custom zones and equipment as well as a few stock zones for 
some familiarity for new players.  It is among the most
well balanced muds with little or none of the politics
plaguing some of the other muds.  The code base is extremely
stable, and the player base very experienced and friendly.

This mud is intended for experienced mudders who desire more
of a challenge from their mud.  Death's Domain requires a mud
client (zmud, gzmud, tintin++ for example).

WWW         : http://www.shattered.org
Description :

  Fourteen (14) years of active development. Administered by
professional software developers and published authors. This
mud has a complex, detailed and sprawling world. This is a
player-centric mud supported by innovative and interesting
economic, legal and ecological systems.  Players run guilds,
players operate stores, players set prices, and players
build structures throughout the world.

  That said, it is a challenging mud. It's tough at the
bottom as a newbie because this mud has unique and complicated
game play; established players won't just roll over and give
up their turf (or cash!).  Its also tough at the top with
Lords and Guild Leaders responsible for administrative and
legal decisions which maybe unpopular with lesser players.
This encourages an active and participative society.
If you take the time and effort to learn the mud you'll
find it unique and engrossing. Many of our 'hard core'
players have been active for over five years.

  There are many ways to 'play'; it's not a killfest, we
strongly encourage role players and a responsible community.
But it's also a tough simulation; so the traditional
'warrior' adventurer will find plenty to fulfill them.
You'll find 9 innovative races, 11 guilds, 32 quests, like
you've never seen before.  Tough adventuring, big fantasy
world, friends and foes.  Take the time to know Shattered
World and you'll be richly rewarded!

WWW         : http://thejungle.servegame.com/
Description :

 The 'Talisman of Imprisonment' was enscribed, plated in gold and formed
into the shape of a star to disguise its true nature. It was given to Azerax
anonymously for his 50th birthday. Azerax, thinking he finally earned some
long awaited recognition, proudly wore the cursed artifact. His first
teleport spell thereafter, brought him to a remote island, from which he
could find no escape.

 Years passed by, as Azerax tried to figure out why he was unable to leave
the isle. He managed to discern the true nature of the talisman; no magic of
his, directly or indirectly, would allow him to leave. Perhaps it was this,
or the penetrating loneliness that led him to create the first enchanted
animal. Azerax used his special enchantment to change other animals: lions,
tigers, bears, turtles, insects, and whatever other animal he could find.
The only animals that were not changed were the animals that were to be
raised for food (cows, chickens, etc). One hundred and six species were
transformed in all. A thriving city was formed- made up of intelligent
animals. Azerax taught them all he could about civilization, acting as their
king.

 The boundary law has been revoked - allowing the animals to explore a
world they never had the conscious to know. That is where you come in, Brave
Adventurer. Go out and explore the world, have spectacular journeys,
complete dangerous quests, seek your fame and fortune, and secure the ideals
of the only place you ever knew - The Jungle.

game fun. So, whacha waiting for?! Stop on by and say hello!

 A total revamping of A Dark Portal, first created in 1998, this MUD is

along in the future, and what's there now is listed <a
href=http://adarkportal.com/nwchanges2.html>here</a>.

 The world is all-original, grouped into seven huge regions corresponding
to the seven well-developed playable races. (More are to come.) On the

Telnet      : americanairport.us 3000 [69.56.206.82]
WWW         : None
Description :

 GalaxyMUD is purely a space simulation. All bodies (stars,
planets, etc..) do not have hard-coded paths - movement is
based off laws of gravitation, F=Ma, and realistic collision
equations. Players can create spacecraft / planets / stars
and see how they react with the rest of the galaxy.
Electromagnetic "waves" have also been added to the simulation.
Although still in the testing phase, these "waves" travel at
the speed of light and can a) be blocked by a body (light),
b) bounce off from a body (RADAR), or c) be absorbed into a
body (energy weapon).

Currently the simulation is in a bare-bones state. It will take
some knowledge of orbital mechanics to create properly orbiting
spacecraft.

It is hoped that this simulation can someday be expanded to a
playable science fiction game. There are additional features
planned for the MUD, but at this point, the MUD is purely
research / testing orientated.

various features of the codebase.  This is still where most of us hang
out and play with the new toys.  Some of our latest features include:

-  7 base classes, 38 subclasses, 6 player races, and over 1200 spells,
prayers, songs, skills, and abilities.
- The ability to abbreviate commands, mobs, items, names, or abilities.
- Descriptive alignment based combat system with race-based natural
weapons, ranged weapons and spells, and mounted combat.

forest, or become a were-creature from that bite.
- Lieges and Vassals
- Area conquest, allowing you to subjugate the villagers and write your
own laws of the land.
- Full clan, guild, fellowship, and union support, including politics,
alliances, and automated membership management. 
- One of our favorite classes, the Artisan.  Gain experience by using
your crafting skills.  As you improve, so does the quality of your

visit these places.
 
We know these places.

And like the monster under the bed, or the ghost in the basement,
these places are all the more terrifying for their familiarity
when the fear strikes. Like the dark whispers you heard from your
closet as a child, the sounds of fear and of madness are all the
more sharp and piercing when they fall from the lips of those
we know.

We live in this place. It's not removed, it's not distant, 
it's not exotic. It's home. And the terrors and monsters
and nightmares are here with us.

currently set up for core rules and Vampire the Requiem. We

================================================================

Elderain MUD is an RP enforced mud that just opened on March 1st
(2005). Were running all original areas and the mud is based in 
the world of Elderain, a custom campaign setting created by my 
co-owner Mike.

Some of our features include:

> Perm Death - If a player is killed by another player the 
loser will be dead forever.  We decided to go with this 
method to ensure fresh role-play.
> Introduction System - Players will only know other players 
by their short description unless they're introduced to that 
player.
>  DM Points - Players are awarded this points for excellent 
role-play and may use them for restring, personal restore, 
minor magical item and so on.  The possibilities are endless.
>  Immortal Driven Quests - Immortals are able to create 
quests on their own.  There are quests almost everyday!  
We also have automated quests.
>  Carriages/Ships - Can carry players from one city to the next
if they choose not to walk across the vast wilderness.
>  Political System - Players can be lords of cities, guards in 
towns, member of the city council, etc.

The entire concept behind Elderain MUD is that the player runs 
the show.
The immortals are only here to assist in behind the scenes 
issues and will not interfere with the role-play in any way.

You can view our campaign at:  http://campaign.elderainmud.com

Check us out; we know you won't be disappointed!

So now its actually a hella

Hi! My name is Christoffer AKA Zat.

I had some ppl wishing Seeds of Hate wouldnt have gone into the grave and since I
have the released codebase I offered to run a MUD using this code...

So thats where we are =) Fixed some bugs and added some classes... Need more areas
tho but there are enough to begin in. We have hidden shops, where you use the gold
you get from killing/selling.

We dont have much class armor.. some classes gets 1-2 pieces so you have to buy
your eq. This isnt like most dystopias! Its hard to master this MUD. We offer
levels, wpn skills, wpn forging hidden shops (I know mentioned before but its cool!)

Well we tried to rebuild the original SoH because so many loved that MUD but we
will add our own stuff to it too... Because I almost know for sure you people have
some great ideas! So come tell us!

Description :

In a world ruled by Deities with powers beyond mortal
  comprehension, mortal man and his sentient beastly kindred
walk among some of the greatest heroes and villains ever to exist
in the human consciousness. Emperor Palpatine and Lord Vader
inhabit the same world as Sir Lancelot and the Greco-Roman Gods.
Choose your path among the mortals, honour always the deities,
and be sure to watch your back; the wolves here bite.

  Aesir currently has 6 tribes, run by mortals, that aid in
roleplay and player interaction. Most of our areas are original
and we will accept and review areas from anyone, not just
immortals. We have Rebirth and Remort systems in the game. Remort
will brings 8 advanced classes into the game. Questing is
optional and the rewards are as variable as the types of quests.
We like to try to keep a light, relaxed atmosphere, while at the
same time keeping an
open forum for opposing views. 

  Feel free to stop by anytime and if you should need anything,
don't hesitate to ask! Aesir II is a dedication to the origional
Aesir (asgard.viviano.net). It was an incredible piece of work so
the mud is being relaunched on a new port under new management.
Same great mud, better flavor! Also, it has been redone from the
areas it had a long time ago so this is a nostalgia trip that
only the gods could brew up. Happy mudding and see you there!

We are a  'beta' mud, new features are being added all the
time, and thus expect to be at the forefront of testing new
features as well as putting up with the bugs as they are fixed.
 
Here we have arranged some different outcomes of events from
the past. Anakin has died ina pod race when he was younger
and thusly no Darth Vader. Also Palpatine was assassinated
during the formative years of the empire. Become the Emperor
and make all bow to your rule and to those that do not, let them
die by your hand. Or Conversely, be a reformer and try to change
the empire and see if you can survive.

Description :

  The general principal behind The Game is that you are a regular
person, logging into a MUD. The MUD's storyline is everyone has been 
living on this island as long as anyone can remember, except the old 
storyteller. The island is controlled by pirates, and has been cut 
off from the mainland for well over a hundred years. Many people 
believe the mainland to be a myth, since no one else can ever recall 
anyone going there. Many have left in search of the mainland, but 
none have returned. There are stories of a hooded figure that would 
take travellers to the mainland in exchange for souls, but none have 
dared trust this. Several small castles lie abandoned on the island, 
waiting for a new lord to arrive.

We offer 3 forms of PK areas: Lawful(no pk), Neutral(pk but no eq 
loss), and Chaotic(risk chance of loosing eq). We also offer several 
in game games, such as fishing and attacking a castle for gold or 
prestige and other things to do besides killing mobs for xp, and we 
are adding more each day.

We are very liberal in how we want our game played. Role-play is 
wonderful, but not required. The gods will only be taking part in 
disciplinary action when some one is being a real dick. We like the
idea of people being themselves and not being punished for it. We 
are now open for player testing to help work out any final bugs 
before we open for real. When we open for real, the world will be 
much bigger than it is now. Enjoy and thanks for the help!

 We started Version 1.0 back in 1995 and have been building up on that ever since.  For the
last year necrotelicomnicon has been offline, however we are now back and open for business.
With Version 5 on its way we will also shortly be after a group of players to help build and
test.

 Bangor was the choice of starting locations back in Version 1.0 of the world and has now
stuck, however it has now expanded further beyond to London which offers a full London
Underground for players to navigate (and get lost in) and visit various attractions.

 From the cinema in Bangor, players may visit a number of films, including Star Wars,
Aliens and Batman and interact with all the main characters, seeing the film through to its
conclussion in order to leave the area.

 Other areas start off in modern day and then lead off on a tangent, for instance, enter a
medievil book in the University Library which leads into an area with the gods from norse,
greek, aztec, and more, religions. Or visit a wargaming store in Brighton to lead into a
Battletech area.

 In the current version (4.1) we have created a totally new and unique leveling system
spanning 500 levels, involving not just experience points and meta, but objects, mobs,
secret rooms, gold and much more.

 We look foreward to seeing you soon and hopefully we can all build this once great mud
back to its former glory.

(attacking NPCs is usually fatal, for example). The world is
designed as a playground for RPers, not hack & slash.

You'll be expected to RP the races as we've designed them, not
as you found them in some book, but we will be lenient when
what we do differs from the norm. In most cases you can have 
input into their final form, as there's lots of development 
left to do.

Open for playtesting. No fear of pwipes - we use text pfiles
and fix them rather than delete them.

Description :

Welcome to MSA:Oozora! Where we try to tailor to EVERYONE's desires.
We strive for customization and a wide variety of concepts, while
trying to maintain a simple-to-use system. MSA is suitable for all
ages, featuring unique methods of censorship that allows pretty much
anything to go on, without destroying young children.

Customization? We've got that!
  - An intricate job system, based around Final Fantasy X-2 that also
    allows coders to create unique jobs.
  - Privacy rooms and togglable censor filters to appeal to all ages
  - A real world with dimensional portals, the real world containing
    plots and quests for players to go through, and the other worlds
    being based solely around collection and destruction. The player
    can go between the two concepts freely.
  - A random encounter battle system that allows different monsters
    to appear in the same places, based on circumstances
  - Choice between Active Time Battle (Commands happen automatically)
    or Charge Time Battle (Take your time to decide the best course)
  - Mini-games to pass the time when bored
  - Party system that allows you to party with any combination of up
    to 4 other players, NPCs or pets, with a unique exp system that
    allows any level variance without unbalancing the game.
  - MXP and Pueblo enhanced, not required, but heavily recommended.

While the MUD is still in development, some of these features are
not available to all players and only playtesters, builders, or
coders, just depending on what phase of testing they are in. We are
currently hiring playtesters or builders. (People are allowed to
play but are subject to pwipes at anytime, without compensation
Coders will be hired upon succesful completion of several conditions,
such as building requirements, willingness to learn, ability to
follow instructions and more.

Description :

Xaos is a gigantic frame work that eagarly caters to the creative 
player.  Featuring an overly active coder and builder staff it 
accomodates basically any desired location for the fantasy RPGer.  
We have a loyal playerbase who work as a community within the OOC 
means, socially a very helpful mud.  Dozens of races, dozens of 
subclasses and hundreds of locations to visit.  The majority of a 
character's life span is spent within thier hero levels, where 
you've mastered your class's skills and now seek to attain grander 
goals of anything you can dream up to attempt.

Xaos is currently very item-centric, with most of the valuable 
objects coming from random generators its all but impossible to see 
two people wearing the same stuff.

The mud is unfortunately not friendly for new mudders and without a 
friend who's already played Xaos a new comer to muds and even Xaos 
will most likely be lost.  The basic rules by which everything 
works have however been geared to avoid giving the veterans 
unmatchable advantages and there is no way to essentially cripple 
your character by making an uneducated decision about how you 
progress.

Player input is highly valued, a prime example is the heavy usage 
of the idea spool, where any player is capable of commenting and 
adding to the creative process of how the mud expands or is 
modified.

Xaos is and probably always will be perpetually in BETA.
Xaos has never had nor ever will have a pwipe.
Xaos is Xaos.  Come play in the mud. ;)

Description :

  The world of Enity is a strange place. Many realms exist here,
and each is governed by a powerful god or goddess. There is also
a forsaken realm with no god at all, which most simply consider
the 'Rogue' realm.

  The world of Enity is a pre-indusrial society, and many
strange and magical beasts make their home here. The realms with
gods are infused with magic and power, so there is no need for
machines. Weapons are prevalent, but very different from realm to
realm, and may be more common in some places than others. The
possibility of machinery exists only in the rogue realm, where
magic is limited. However, their technology is not very advanced.

  [When you play at Enity, there are hundreds of choices you can
make about your characters. The only limit is your imagination.
We have very few strict rules, and once you have established your
first character, you will be allowed to create others. We are
very open-minded, and want you to have a good time. We are mostly
an original theme, with influences from Black & White, the novel
American Gods, Egyptian and Greek society, and the novel
Hyperion, to name a few. You need not know anything about these
influences to enjoy and understand this game.]

Description :

     Welcome to the Lands of Light and Darkness. Seven months ago, 
an adventure began that will never end. People have fought, explored, 
discovered quests, lived the life of a powerful hero or a quiet 
craftsperson. They have found paths to new cities and new lands; they
have found new skills, spells, and crafts, and the future holds much more.

Some choose the Light. They have an easier path of it. Those lands are 
stable, and ruled by law. Some choose the Darkness. They choose a harsh 
home, where the only laws are made by those around them. 

We expected the Light to have the roleplay, and the Darkness to be 
hack and slash, and PvP. The Darkness has surprised us with its 
roleplay, and the degree that players help one another, but still, each 
land has a feel of its own. If one does not suit you, the other may.

Fighting is, as always, a sure way to advance. But, there are a multitude
of other ways. Buy a ship, large or small, and sail to far-off lands. Find
a gemstone, carve it, and set it into jewelry. Learn embroidery, the craft
that has daunted many a proud warrior. Study many other crafts; you'll
learn from them. Heal the injured. Sit in town square and gab. 

Don't arrive expecting to find familiar gameplay. The chances are
high that you'll have to revise your expectations. You'll find other
people ready and eager to help you, though, and there's plenty of 
room for your name in the history books! 

We've created a unique blend of fantasy and realism here. Come 
join the adventure of a lifetime and make a place for yourself 
to call home.

..and as had been foretold, the Cataclysm occurred. It was
not the end of the world as many had feared, but nothing
would ever be the same again. Humans could no longer
continue their blinkered existance. The old realities had
been forever shattered and the dreams had been let loose
in the land. Drawing on this new power, the Ancient Races
re-appeared. No longer did they have to cloak their
comings and goings. The very earth hummed with power and
even the most sceptical had to acknowledge that the safe
order of things was no more. Reactions varied: some
embraced the old ways and magic returned to the lands,
some retreated to sheltered enclaves and developed new and
amazing technologies, some gained the stars, some lost
their minds. It was a dangerous and chaotic world, but the
rewards were great for those brave enough to embrace the
dream. Elusive Dreams has been up and running for over 5
years now and has developed some unique and interesting
features. Roleplaying is strongly encouraged by clans
which are totally player created and run. If there isn't
one to suit your tastes, then you can always start your
own! 219 levels and 15 remorts gives you plenty of time to
create some depth to your character. Come on by!

The humans despised the PSI for thier powers, but the PSI tried to
work with the humans to help each other.

Eventually both races separated into different parts of the world. The
humans claimed the lower parts of new york for their new capitol city,
because thier were still buildings there.

The PSI took a deserted city in upper russia to build thier city.
They called it Aureal City.

Description :

Shattered by a war between creators of the highest ranks and the
following tyrannie of those who'd won turned the once living place
into a cold and desolated void.

Back in 93 when the 'linzer' admins led by patience moved on to
create a new world based upon a updated mudlib, holy mission was
given to a couple of Archwizards who choosed to stay. In those
days, the world was highly populated and easily reached the cap of
60 simultaneous players. Packed with many guilds, some of them
hidden and very restricted, quests, legendary monsters and a broad
community from all walks of life and nations made this game fun to
play.

But that was not to be meant for long. One amongs the ranks of the
creators, he and his friends did all he could do to destroy, what
other wizards and players had created. Holy Mission fell and when
no living thing crawled over the damned world anymore, even he
went on.

Today a few fans are working on this old piece to give old players
the chance to return and remember and to give new players the
chance to see how a mud looked like back in 1991. Holy Mission is
nothing compared to modern muds like Achaea or BatMud, but its an
original with a out-of-the box village from 2.4.5 lib and
padrone's castle.

A long time ago in a galaxy far far away there was a world that

thousands of years. Until one day when a small group started to 
feel that a change was necessary so that the mortals they ruled 
over could survive. The other gods disagreed with the changes that
the small group of gods wanted to make.  So the small group of 
gods tired everything they could to persuade the others into 
change. In the end the gods were exiled to a different realm by 
the other gods.  Here the gods created a world beyond the exiled.
Over the years the world has grown in ways it was never thought 
possible and now is ready to be explored by new race of mortals.

to surrender. Small rebel factions joined forces, tyrannical empires
combined their might, and numerous people went to wander the Worlds
and the space in between then, alone but still fighting, refusing to
give up hope and determined to learn more about what those strange
creatures had done to their homes. Even though threats-- some new,
some old, some beyond all imagination-- lurk just around the corner,
the people refuse to give up, continuously pushing forward. And so
their story begins...Based on Kingdom Hearts, sans the Disney,

WWW         : http://www.theunwelcome.com
Description :

In 2009, the population of New Jersey experienced a huge 
masquerade breach on a scale that shocked both the
supernatural and mortal population, threatening the 
stability of mortal ignorance and, in essence, the 
safety of the supernatural population on the whole.

Leading up to this event were 
equally appalling incidents that began to 
shake the foundation of the state and 
its already questionable population and governance. 
The first was the movement of three government-run 
law enforcement agencies into the private sector,funded 
and controlled by wealthy corporate executives who 
remain shrouded in mystery. The second was the 
onslaught of law suits that threatened to turn 
New Jersey's most prized natural resource, 
the Pine Barrens, into one large highway 
dotted by strip malls and
bars.

There is the aggressive stance 
New Jersey's governor has taken against the
Supreme Court when it came time to tax the casino's 
in Atlantic City, his arguments and 
protestations creating a political environment 
of active hostility.

And then there is Asbury Park, one of the six cities 
featured on our grid, where police don't 
dare go after the riots created a level of chaos 
and violence that the state would rather just 
contain than actually fix. 

The Unwelcome is not a fluffy game.  It is a 
realistically portrayed World of Darkness 
allowing Mortal, Mortal+, Vampire, Shifter, and Mage.

Mud         : Ultimate DC Universe
Code Base   : [MUX]
Telnet      : ultimatemux.com 2210
WWW         : http://www.geocities.com/ultimate_dcu/index.html
Description :

The premise behind Ultimate DC is simple and direct. We're taking the
concept presented in Marvel comics line of Ultimate books and 
applying them to the DC Comics Universe(with help from an issue of 
Wizard). The Mux exists in an updated "Year 1" situation for most 
characters(there are exceptions for a few characters detailed 
elsewhere). We intend to reinvent the DC Universe characters in the
same light Marvel reinvented theirs. Keeping the core of the 
characters intact but making them a bit more real, a bit more human,
and a bit darker and edgier in most instances.
     
This is the DC Universe with a healthy dose of the real world. While
the people of the DC Universe have dealt with heroes in the past it's
been more than 30 years since the last hero team was active and even 
then their heroes and villains were, for the most part, human or 
enhanced human(or at least were believed to be so). Now the world 
will have to contend with gods, aliens and all sorts of mystical 
badness in ways they've never dreamed of before.

Telnet      : www.beyond-chaos.com 2550
WWW         : http://www.beyond-chaos.com
Description :

   This MUD is a sequal to the original Aftermath MUD.  
It started out as circleMUD, but there have been significant 
changes to the code.
   There are five races.  Each race is similar to a clan.  
Your race will determine your "home city" and your 
"religion".  There are 13 classes and there are 1500 mortal 
levels, and after completing those levels a player advances
into the 1500 immortal levels. Then there are 500 God levels,
1 God level is for immortals that advance past level 3000 and
the rest are for staff.  
    Very soon I will implement special classes (vampires, 
lycans, zombies, and spirits).  These classes will not 
replace your current class, they will be more like a virus  
that infects the character.  Pkilling is allowed, but not 
on players of your own race.  When you attack a player you 
will not recieve a pkiller tag, but your Max Hit points will 
drop 25%.
   Unfortunatly the zones are all stock.  I am currently 
looking for 1 head builder and as many builders as I can get.  
Please email me if you are interested in one of these 
positions.  Eventually there will be no stock zones left.  
The MUD will have 5 major cities, and the Race of your 
character will determine the city you are from.
   In the mean time feel free to begin playing with your 
character on this mud.

VERY FRIENDLY STAFF
We are a fairly new mud and still working out some minor problems,
but we are always open to suggestions via our forums.
The game is based about 20 or so years after the destruction of the 
first deathstar, we are not totally accurate yet but are working on 
it. Still needing builders. Right now we have about 38 planets, 37
 starsytems, and 47 areas. Updated space system with 46 ships 
availiable all of which can be upgradeed via addin modules.
Nice cargo system and Player Owned shops also help players gather 
fundage. Cloning is availiable.. if you can find it and afford it :).
We are always trying to add new code or update existing code, so 
things are always changing. Force is rolled like stats at character
creation, so you never know who has got it and who dont untill they
are "sensed" by an existing forcer. Several races and classes to 
choose from. You now have choice of 2 classes, a primary and 
secondary, so basically you can have 2 skill sets plus what ever the
race roll gives you, and of course we have the RP points system that
you can redeem for skill levels and or to a specific skill.

Forget about the orcs and monsters in other games - Fed II has real
challenges for grownups!
Like day trading commodities futures and launching an IPO for your

power and money. 
Things that matter in real life. Federation II is a newly rewritten
version of the original Federation with all the charm and humor of 
the original but adding new features and challenges based on our 
15 years of multiplayer game experience and players requests. 
There are new ranks, new planets, new features, new challenges, 
new things to do.

Come play Federation II for free and enjoy the excitement again.
We'll even throw in a set of starter maps of the Solar System. 

Now Announcing:

NEW VERSION OF FEDTERM ADDS LOTS OF EXTRA FEATURES

Fed Term is the new GRAPHICAL front end for Federation II.
This means players will be able to supply their own custom
avatar picture to display on their own computer as well as
all the other players while in the game. It also means pictures 
of your ship. 

And it also means AutoMapping! Really easy to use, intuitive 
automapping built in, ready to use. 

And it means, graphic stat displays for you and your spaceship.
And, a new multi-tabbed pane to display and communicate with all
the other players in the game and a special friends panel.
And many more useful and nifty features players have asked for!

The new Fed Term makes playing Federation II more than a text 
game. It's becoming an exciting synthesis of Graphic and Text!

Mud         : Darkness Beneath the Fog: London by Night
Code Base   : [AFKMud]
Telnet      : pix.isa-geek.com 7111 [pix.isa-geek.co]
WWW         : http://www.geocities.com/london_nights_wod
Description :

Darkness Beneath the Fog: Welcome to modern day London, England. But 
this new London is not the one that we know and love. Rather, this 
is a London filled with Vampires, Shapeshifters, Magic, and a labour 
government. In this London, a place beneath the world mortals see 
exists. A darker place. A world of Darkness.
The streets of London are no longer a safe place for children to 
play, for adults to stroll leisurely, for law enforcement to patrol. 
So frightening has the city become that law enforcement can't always 
be counted on to maintain the safety of London's inhabitants. Take 
head...you are on your own.

Darkness Beneath the Fog is a newly opened World of Darkness MUSH 
based off the White Wolf World of Darkness, using a combination of 
2nd and 3rd edition rules to encourage RP as well as alternative 
thinking. The game currently supports Shifters, Changeling, Kindred, 
and Mage, with some Demons thrown in for good measure. 
The Shifter sphere is accepting Garou, Bete, Corax, Ratkin, and many 
other Tribes. The Kindred sphere is open for Anarchs, Independents, 
Camarilla and Sabbat. Mage has openings for almost all the various 
mages including Verbena, VA, CoE, and Hermes (but not limited to 
those). Technocrats will be accepted in the near future. The 
Changeling sphere will be open for Seelie, Unseelie and Motley, and 
group apps are encouraged. Demons are being accepted on a case by 
case basis, and the wraith sphere will be opening once the game is 
in full swing.
London has a strong staff committed to making the RP experience an 
enjoyable one for all players involved. There are a great many 
opportunities to get involved in one of the many sphere and mush-
wide TPs constantly being planned, and staff welcomes players who 
wish to be a TP hook for a new TP.
Stop in and check us out...we'll be watching for you.

Acadiana is new character friendly and has a dedicated staff team to
assist players needs. Acadiana offers a custom character creation
process so the possibilities of two characters being alike are very
slim. Acadiana has a wide selection of character professions to choose
along with any profession you may have from working for another
character. Some of these professions include, police officers,
emergency medical technicians, fire fighters, government officials
including judges and courthouse clerks. There are three basic cities
to which a character can live, work, or play. Acadiana offers and
bases everything on realism and not only encourages role-play but
also offers other ways (built-in systems) instead of forcing role
plays. Characters, if chosen during the creation process, have the
ability to be killed by another character, and to go along with
that, acadiana has an incorperated violence setting for those that
do not wish to participate in limited or no violence. The staff at
Acadiana are friendly and will accept and comments, concerns, or
suggestions about we the MOO lacks or what would like to be seen.

Description :

Based on a fantasy world that incorporates the mythos of 
varying cultures; ranging from the arcane mages and mystical 
druids of the west to the pious monks and crafty ninjas of 
the east. Equipment and areas are based entirely on the unique 
flavor of these major (or perhaps just plainly popular)
 cultures. Our world begins in the west, roughly that of 
Mid-Western Europe, as we continue to form a world filled 
with sights and sounds, occasional caravans bringing rare 
items will visit major cities bringing rumors, and tales of 
adventures as a taste of what is to come. When a unique region 
is opened to the players, so will the chance to create a 
new character based on a class exclusive to that territory be 
given. As knowledge of the unknown world is revealed the 
known world continues to change and evolve. Epic struggles of 
power, fame, and greed rage on in a land filled with myth, 
legend, and intrigue.

extensive branching of expertise due to the excellent Shadowrun skill
system.
We also feature a large world to explore and play in, over 10000
rooms, ranging from the Seattle Metroplex and Tacoma, to the rugged
wilderness of Sinsearach and are presently continuing building the
already large Portland Metroplex. All locations are extensively
detailed and ready for consumption.
Our staff are also very newbie friendly, offering help to new and
veteran players who are stuck in a jam.
The codebase is heavily evolved, becoming very true to Shadowrun 3rd
Edition in both mechanics and spirit. With the recent inclusion of an
advanced decking (read: computer hacking) and magic system, all
character types are catered for.

The Land of Legends focuses on a medieval fantasy setting with
role-play strongly encouraged. We have guilds, orders, and clans
available along with 108 areas currently online with additional
areas currently in production. We currently offer 14 races and
11 classes to choose from, though we have several new races and
classes on the way. There have been a great many changes to code,
skills, spells, etc with even more on the way.

We have an online alias system so you don't need a mud client to 
be an effective player. We issue every new player with a very
comprehensive newbie guide. We feature a customizable prompt
system that can even include a 'bar graph' reflecting your
opponents remaining life. We have a buddy notification system
to let you know when your friends log on or off or when they
gain a level. Our help system is very well maintained and we have
a corresponding help file for ever command, skill, spell, area,
and for most other common subjects, of course, most of the help
topics are also covered in your newbie guide. We have wedding code
in place. Our whole mud color theme is customizable for each
player. We have hotboot capabilities, so game play almost never
needs to be interrupted for a reboot. We have much more in the
works as well.

Come test your mettle and see if you can attain Avatar powers today!

Mud         : Simply Marvelous: Current Marvel Universe MUX
Code Base   : [MUX] MUX 2.3.3.22 #1
Telnet      : currentmarvel.mushpark.com 2004 [66.220.26.12]
WWW         : http://www.currentmarvel.mushpark.com
Description :

Heralded by Reed Richards' ill-fated shuttle flight the world as 
we know it has entered a state of rapid evolution. Costumed 
vigilantes stand as protectorate over the urban jungles 
battling crime law enforcement can no longer contain. World 
governments have legally sanctioned teams of heroes to head off 
powered threats both foreign and domestic. Higher beings have 
made contact with the Earth: their presences known and their 
awe-inspiring powers an unsettling influence upon the mortals 
below. Racism stands at an all time high, the color of one's 
skin no longer as important as the quality of one's genes.

Imagine walking through the streets of New York and seeing an 
airborne duel between Spider-Man and the Green Goblin Imagine 
tuning into CNN and seeing images of a suspected group of mutant 
terrorists called the 'X-Men' fighting unknown mutants in some 
exotic location. Imagine flipping through the Daily Bugle and 
reading about the Avengers' press conference detailing their 
recent victory over alien invaders on another world. Imagine 
watching broadcasters on E! gossip over the activities on one 
of America's most favorite families, the Fantastic Four.  
   
We hope to make these types of scenarios, and more, visual to 
you in a fun and creative way. The staff and players at (the) 
Current Marvel Universe want to bring your favorite heroes and 
villains 
from Marvel comics to life. Our story takes place in present day, 
so you might see Jubilee discussing the latest fashion trends, 
Leech playing the newest video game, or Dazzler singing the 
latest pop song. The setting is that of Marvel comics published 
now, 2004/5.

 Builders and Coders to help us achieve our goals.  
We are replacing the current areas with all original 
ones, in addition to expanding the world.  Classes are

 with an extensive list already drawn up, in addition 
to many other changes that will be added over the next

Mud         : Shadowrun London
Code Base   : [MUSH] Unmodified TinyMUSH
Telnet      : pix.isa-geek.com 7112
WWW         : http://
Description :

Based upon a somewhat modified form of the Shadowrun system and
setting, Shadowrun London is a roleplaying MUSH with judged combat
and plots.  The emphasis is on street level RP in a setting with
bite.  Magic is downplayed (though still present) and the MUSH
is focused firmly upon cyberpunk themes.

In a dystopian world not too many years in the future, 
Britain has lapsed into isolationism and largely succumbed
to the dictatorial control of the Lord Protector of England.  
The information tendrils of the database state extend through 
the Matrix with few escaping its grip.  Anarchists who choose 
or are forced to live outside mainstream society fight the 
soldiers who try to maintain order and stifle unrest on the 
streets of south London.  Meanwhile, behind the scenes, 
ruthless corporations do anything to improve their bottom line 
and powerful Triads sell mind altering computer chips to 
the disaffected masses in the latest drug craze of the 21st 
century.

In addition to the usual Shadowrun staples of deckers, street 
samurai and the like, we support a wide range of cyberpunk 
concepts - cops, chip dealers, rockers, gangers, Triads, 
software pirates, and more besides.  Character generation is 
points based to give maximum flexibility to concepts.

The server is in the US but most of the staff and many players 
are European, consequently the mush is at its most active around 
2pm-7pm EST, though we are looking to improve our global coverage.

Description :

Land of the Unforgiven is a heavily modified Dystopia Gold. 
The areas have been COMPLETELY wiped and all exp areas and 
Midgaard are from scratch. At the moment the world is fairly
small, but plenty of room for a lot of exping and PK. There
are new areas being added EVERY DAY. There are 18 classes at
the moment, with more to come, possibly including Skyblades
from MCloud and Wraiths from EoD. The statcap is 20k with 4k
added per kill, but the classes and equipment are modified
to reflect this. The average test player has taken two to
three hours to max a character, but mastery is possible in
half an hour or less with the stancetrain, spelltrain, and
weapontrain commands.

This is a breath of fresh air from every kid who thinks he
can run his own EoD, and when all end up looking the same.
Give us a try, you won't want to leave.

WWW         : http://
Description :

if you have played Elite series of game, then you know what inspired
me to do this MUD. Also books written by 'Harry Harrison' especially 
'Deathworld' and 'Stainless Steel Rat'

the story: [not even started to making areas* - all stock now]
mars was colonized and partially terraformed. none other planet in 
Sol couldnt be. but on every bigger piece of rock is a kind of base 
or colony. so there is much trade [also done by players]
then other planets were found. [star names and locations based upon 
astromomisal data, still working on it]
some of them having their own lifeforms [just like in "deathworld" :)]
others being only mining colonies or factories. so that way the Earth 
Federation was formed. it's member were all earth countries and 
their colonies. but some bigger colonies [with heavier industry and
science] started rebellion, against that "Earth Empire" and in 
several interstellar wars formed "League of Free Worlds".
and then the play begins...

technicals:
- modules to upgrade your ships
- more realistic space ships**
- possibility to land ANYWHERE on the planet**
- building of houses on planet surfaces**
- destroying and bombing them**
- players making and running colonies**
- hiding behind the barrels, crates.**
- armor has no AC. instead when hit IN CERTAIN BODY PART armor on 
THAT PART reduces the damage**
- characters could have families, and leave their cash and position 
to their offsprings**
- medicine: doctors, breaking bones, diseases, etc. **

*)looking for area builders. mail me if you want to help building 
earth. it should be dark and cyberpunk-like. full of drugs and 
violence. but ranged weapons [blasters/grenades] should be HIGHLY 
illegal and anyone having it will be shot dead by the police. but 
there also will be 'higher class' of citizents.living in "Garden of 
Eden"s closed for normal people.
**) to be added.

as well as stunning to the imagination. 
BSAE runs on a dedicated dell poweredge 400sc, off a cable line. 
Most of the programming work thats been put in, has been to a
project we call the builder bot. This is a bot that pulls 
randomly from seed files, and creates enormous worlds for 
players to explore. The idea behind this being to leave the 
filler rooms to the bot, and let the builders do the fun stuff.
BSAE is a mud that will be a far cry from traditional 
mudding experiences. we have vision, we have talent, we have a wide 
variety of resources, and we are quite determined;

F'nor came and claimed the lands around as his own. He was kind, 
and the light he brought was very appreciated by the masses of 
people that had been living in darkness for so long. F'nor, and 
his dragon Canth, were Gods in the eyes of those around. But there 
was one who remembered the darkness. One who found the light to 
be oppressing, and not as benevolent as those around. Her heart 
was as pitch, black and thick with hatred. This one was Alys. 
Alys had seenhow F'nor did his tricks and powers, and soon 
taught herself to emulate those powers, although she could not 
match F'nor's power in those skills. She planned to overthrow 
F'nor and return the world to the state of darkness it was 
before, the way she remembered and loved....

new stuff soon!

 It is based on the anime series, Dragon Ball/Z/GT and so
there are areas from the shows to explore as well as the 
choice to be an icer, human or even a saiyan(plus many 
others!). There are infamous signature moves including 
Kamehameha and Deathball. If you like muds and you love
DBZ this is the place for you..heck if you like roleplay 
and/or games come check us out!

 Recently added were new areas and the races of demon
and genies, the genie race is 100% original and a new 
kind of race for most DBZ muds. As our player base 
grows and expands everday, and new features aid the mud
we're growing all the time and looking great!

Merthaen is a young mud in desperate need of coders and builders,
heavily under construction and meant to stay thay way.
Though we do currently have some stock area's, 
we are looking to replace them all with original area's,
rather than add new areas and keep stock. 

Roleplay is encouraged on Merthaen. 
It comes with an amount of clans all with storylines 
that somehow involve other clans.
There's a set of Merthaen Area's (Merthaen City,
Merthaen Castle, Merthaen Forest, etc) 
that will function as the main area's of the Mud.

Here's a little list of what Merthaen has to offer.

Several Classes
Several Races
Detailed Charactarization
A base of set Clans
A Remort System
One of the most advanced OLC systems around.

Do feel free to have a look. Merthaen.akbearsden.com 4777

It is based on Markanth's 1stMud code.

Mud         : SpyGames

Telnet      : spygames.mudmagic.com 2007 [69.64.37.210]
WWW         : http://spygames.mudmagic.com/
Description :

In August of 1989, the overthrow and execution of Mikhail Gorbachev
by hardliners within the Politburo and military leadership of the
Soviet Union brought a sudden, and jarring end to the brief period
of detente that had been fostered by Perestroika.  Encouraged by
the events in the USSR, several other Communist nations would
subsequently crack down on efforts to democratize.  This, when
combined with the events earlier in the year in Beijing, led to a
worsening of relations between NATO and the various Communist
nations around the world to a point not seen since the early part
of the 1960s...

SpyGames is a modern day espionage themed MUSH set in an 
alternate history where the Cold War never actually ended.  
The players are assumed to be spies stationed in the 
East German border city of Waldenberg, located on the 
southern shore of the Baltic Sea, near Hamburg and Lübek.
This location makes Waldenberg a primary setting for
espionage activities of all sorts.  Most major nations
have agents in place, as does an international Criminal
and Terrorist organization, the Front Organization for 
Revenge, Crime, and Espionage (or FORCE.)  The game strives
for a feel similar to the early, less gadget oriented James 
Bond adventures, a typical John LeCarre, Ken Follet, Len 
Deighton or Tom Clancy novel, or an episode of Alias or 
Spooks/MI-5.  We emphasize investigation and intrigue 
instead of over the top action,and character interaction 
over combat.

The game is running on a stock install of PennMUSH version 
1.8.0 (the newest stable release version,) and uses a 
variation of the West End Games D6 system.  
Players can, once the game opens, choose to play 
agents from any of the world's major spy orgainzations,
as well as citizens and non agent visitors, and even 
agents of FORCE.

We hope to have the game open by summer of 2005.

Description :

The inhabitants of Earth knew this day would come eventually.  Still,
 when it finally came, no one could believe it was really true.  The
 population of Earth had grown beyond the limited space of the planet.
  The solution was clear.  It had been discussed for years.  A planet
 much like a very primitive Earth had been discovered many light 
years away.  Thankfully, space travel had now advanced to the point 
that the distance could be covered in a relatively short time.
The problem now was that no one wanted to leave Earth.  So, who 
would go?  The solution came relatively quickly.  Orphans, criminals
and other outcasts from society would be sent to the new planet to
live.  From a statistics perspective, it was a good decision.  The
ones who would be left on Earth could keep all of their 
resources, because they did not feel the resources should be

Description :

    Dark Desires is an adult themed mux and should be joined only by
those who are considered of Legal Age for their home country. DD is
based on an original theme of a mad mage who created a portal to 
escape the rules and laws of his home land.When he landed on the
surface of Lumina, the moon which the planets that make up this
unique little perversional haven orbit arround, yes... the planets
orbit the moon, not the other way around. He attempted to create and
control vortexes with which to suck unsuspecting women from various 
different planets to populate his little dark fantasy, what he had 
hoped would become his breeding stock,something went terribly 
wrong.The magic backfired, killing him immediately and leaving the 
vortexes spiraling out of control. They opened for minute seconds on 
every land, every realm, every universe, only to suck whatever 
creature stood by them into DD's atmosphere. They were random and 
uncontrollable. No magic posessed by those who had been trapped here 
was strong enough to close the vortexes and so more people come 
daily. Each of the five planets was cursed with a particular 
perversion, drawing those who shared the dark fantasies to which the 
planets were bound. Each new person finding their most casual 
fantasies stronger, more powerful, more demanding. This is our Dark 
Desire... will you join us?

Destiny's Waltz MUSH is a crossover of the Gundam Wing AC Universe
and the Gundam Seed Destiny CE Universe. Players should be familiar
with at least one of the universes to more effectively RP characters.
Most characters are characters played in the series, although original
characters are looked at.

The Gundam Wing side is set in the year AC 196 before the events of
Endless Waltz. The Gundam Seed Destiny is set at some point early in 
the Gundam Seed Destiny universe.

Both universes are connected via a C.E. Federation developed secret 
experiment known as a Shift-Phase Gate. Through this gate, contact
between the Blue Cosmos (A radical anti-genetic engineering faction) 
and Mariemaier's Forces (A secret colony militia headed by Dekim 
Barton) have formed a secret cross-dimensional alliance.

What lies in store for the heroes of each universe? Only time will
tell.

Description :

Veracity of Death is the return of the Midnight Dreams based
codebase Midnight Realities continuing where Smoo left off. The mud
includes 14 total classes, 5 of them being original ideas created by
Smoo himself(Not like dystopias which are cloned classes with
renamed skills and a few different powers). Every class is balanced
where each class is put into a small triangle where they have
strengths and weaknesses towards another class(Such as Vampire over
Demon, Demon over Wereolf, and Werewolf over Vampire which makes it
realistic). Veracity of Death includes a 2 tier system which gives
the player more to do while online. All ideas put into the mud are
going to be unique, not seen on every godwars like most today who
just copy eachother. Anybody whos played Midnight Dreams or Midnight
Realities knows its not a contest to see who can dedicate their
lives to exping. This is not a mud where the guy with no life
becomes the top player because hes on 24/7 and trains his stats far
above anyone else. I've run a handful of muds and played godwars
muds since the idea was created so I know what it takes to make a
good mud and what the players want since Ive been in their position.
Ever wonder what its like to play a mud where the immortals actually
LISTEN to your ideas and explain why the idea is bad instead of just
shooting it down. Also there is absolutely no immortal cheating
tolerated, they are instantly removed unless they have one hell of a
story. Every immortal is logged and each alt is checked frequently
to make sure they are legit. I dont even use an alt to prevent
having people making accusations :P. I am currently hiring a coder
and probably a builder to help make this mud original with new areas
n maybe a new town(midgaard is too stock).

Stop by and try the mud out, you wont be disappointed,
Immortal Staff of VOD

P.S. Thanks to Smoo for the codebase and Tenny who dedicated alot of
time fixxing small problems with the code that I didnt even notice
until recently.

The year is 2063. Decades ago, space was opened up, for
exploration, for development, and for colonisation. Now, the
forces of competing nation-states are scrabbling to expand into
the galaxy, fortifying and industrialising former frontier worlds,
and searching for potential alien allies. One such system, located
near the border of the demilitarised zone between British and French
space, has been thrust into great importance, and now is host to an
impressive military presence.

But not all is well, banditry and piracy are still rife, the
development of the system barely begun, and the uneasy peace
with the French starting to break down.

As a raw recruit to the Royal Space Navy, you must pass through the
Academy, and then work your way up through the ranks by performing
missions, eventually reaching the rank of Commander.

Cryosphere is a Sci-Fi themed MUD that has been built from scratch,
with some Aber influence. We have equipment saving, stores, banks,
insurance, hospitals, wilderness, an integrated ship and docking
system, simulators that you can safely train in, an academy for new
players, an original scenario, and many unique missions.

Ma Ti Lodoa, The fates, your fate, our fate combined. Dare you 
challenge these enemies? The fates of fire and ice, the fates of 
poison and the fate of vampires, the fate of the world.

Three kingdoms. The golden lands of Soren, blessed by light, 
protected by the ancient gods of all that is good. The shadowy realm 
of Cisero, never safe to sleep without a knife close to hand. The 
powerful republic of Kantor, lurking in the ancient forests, bowing 
their heads to no one.. Many races and classes open for choice.. 
Ogres, huge hulking beasts of great strength and constitution.
Barbarians, powerful warriors who shun magic. Draghkars, Dark 
ceatures of the night who control the magical weave as though it was 
art of them. Warlocks, an ancient spellcaster, a relic of the past. 
The Rakasta, an old race, born of the frozen realm of arbadia, these 
limber creatures are violent and well rounded in all fields. 
Clerics, holy warriors of the gods who crusade with healing magic.

The Battles Within is an ever expanding world, based on a leveling 
system in which experiance is gained by killing monsters and players,
the main point is primarily player killing. After you reach a certain
level, level fifty, you can remort, turning into a vastly superior
race and restarting at level six with your creation points set to
fifty (this normally means its alot easier to level.). After you
remort, and get to level fifty five, you can no longer gain 
experiance from mobs, and must either raid enemy  kingdoms crushing 
their leaders, or hunt down the greatest prey, to gain your levels.

"Nothing good can ever come from a witch."

With the murder of the royal family, a grieving monarch sets out 
to eradicate a great evil running rampant through the kingdom of 
Lithmore, and the cause of his pain: magic. His fury and
determination would soon destroy political alliances and forge a new
empire from the ashes of his enemies. The genocide of all those who 
practice the dark arts, however, could not be completed in his day 
alone...

Centuries later, the struggle for survival still rages between all
users of magic and ever-viligant might of the Holy Order. You are 
invited to immerse yourself in the suspicion and mystery of a realm 
embroiled in a clandestine holy war, where honor and politics all
too frequently collide in the battle for the hearts of men, and
magic is real.
 
Will you join in the fight to erase the taint of sorcery from the 
realm - or will you unlock the dark secrets of the forbidden arts, 
and rise against oppression?

Imagine everybody in that town living regularly. Normally. 
Happily. 

Then imagine that town being bombarded by a bunch of two inch 
tall robots.

Pretty messed up, eh?

Welcome to Sahari Town. The only town in the world to have the 
power of the Gotcha Borgs, small robots with phenomenal cosmic 
powers. The only town where the most powerful are the kids who 
command these Gotcha Borgs. 

And the only town that can stop the mighty Death Force from 
destroying the world. 

Side with the Gotcha Force, led by new kid in town, Kou, to fight 
against the Death Force, and the Galactic Emperor, for the fate 
of the world! 

Or maybe you could sign on with the Death Force, and the Galactic
Emperor. Help conquer the earth, and then destroy it! Willingly, 
or otherwise!

On the other hand, not everyone is exactly fond of Gotcha Borgs.
And the Anubis Force exist solely to see Gotcha Borgs wiped off
the face of the earth. And Sho intends to make sure of that.

Or, y’know, you could just be a civilian. Sitting. Watching.
Throwing your popcorn and drinks. Wusses.

Yup, Welcome to Sahari Town. Our last, best hope for Survival.

We are all so screwed.

Gotcha Force MUSH is Rated PG-13 by the assorted conglomerate 
of randomized MUSH ratings.

Gotcha Force is owned by Capcom. This MUSH is entirely non-profit. 

Even if you have no experience with the game in question, our 
friendly and helpful, and not at all evil staff are more than 
willing to help out. The inexperienced and new MUSHers, or just 
those new to the setting, are perfectly welcome.

WWW         : http://www.innominemush.com
Description :

In Nomine: Symphony & Silence MUSH is here to provide an environment 
where those who like the Steve Jackson Games RPG, In Nomine, can enjoy
themselves and roleplay within the environment designed in the game.

At any time, we will be running Story Arcs to further progress the 
game in many different ways. We strive to come up with creative and
interesting plots for all to enjoy. Any players are welcome to submit
plot or Story Arc ideas for use by the MUSH.

The point to In Nomine: Symphony & Silence is player interaction to 
drive a story so that everyone can have fun. Now, this also means that
at times, players will need to give as well as receive both positive 
and negative changes to the in character world and how it affects 
them. Everything will not go your way 100% of the time -- at times 
things can go bad for your character. But during those times, 
remember, so to turns the wheels of a plot, that everyone will have 
fun. Being immersed in the plot allows everyone to drive it forward, 
good or bad.

Canon-wise, we haven't followed any of Revelations just yet, though 
there are plots planned to lead us through those events. We're picking
up in the modern day, 2004/2005, with the events of the core book 
happening just as we open. Anything from the books will more than 
likely happen.

In Nomine: Symphony & Silence is a medium to high contrast game. 
Angels are angels, demons are demons; to state it bluntly. This 
doesn't mean angels are sweet and nice, Angels should be all true to 
what is displayed of them in the In Nomine Core Book. Demons are 
likewise not always outright nasty and evil, some of them can easily 
pass for the nice guy next door, within reason.

So, while we're toward the medium to high range, we expect characters 
across the entire spectrum with more in the range stated than anything
else.

Description :

Imagine a world where the lines of good and evil have long since been
 blurred, where the public heroes are little more than pawns and PR
 opportunities of a secretive government, and the true heroes we've
 always known and loved are forced underground, to fight for truth,
 justice, and the American way under the mantle of vigilante... or
 sometimes worse -- as criminal.

This is not the happy world of DC comics... nor is it the dark world
 of Marvel's X-Men... this is a world that sits in a shadow somewhere
 in-between, a world of secret government agencies, super-soldier
 projects testing on mutants, public distrust of mutants, and secret
 schools devoted to training them. The mutant nation of Genosha is a
 reality. A public criminal calling himself Superman plays hero while
 avoiding capture by government agencies. The existence of magic and
 aliens is categorically denied by those in power.

More information is available on the game. If you're interested in
 playing your favorite Marvel or DC characters in a unique, mixed-
 theme world, or even introducing your own original concept, Denied
 Destinies is finally opening its doors. Heroes and villains alike
 are welcome. Established teams such as the X-Men, The Hellions, and
 The Brotherhood are seeking recruits -- or you could even create
 your own team or choose to go it alone! Prospective players are
 invited to connect now, to check us out, and to offer any questions
 they might have. Applications for new characters will be accepted as
 of January 1st, so come on over!

Rating: PG-13+

A note for MUD players: This is /not/ a MUD. IE: No EXP, No HP, No
 Mana, etc. This is a text-based, roleplaying, interactive fiction
 format. Skills, powers, stats are not predefined. We still welcome
 you to visit us, of course. Just be prepared for an experience

Long ago, space travel was common for variety of alien species.
Worm-holes were, and are, a fairly common occurrence throughout the
tides of space.  The mechanics of these worm-holes have remained a
mystery for many millennia.  The one thing that is certain about
them, they are unpredictable. The wormhole that leads to Galaxus was
discovered by a smuggler by the name of Janus.  When her vessel
entered the worm-hole, unexpectedly, she was transported to
a ‘pocket-galaxy’.   A galaxy within a galaxy.   Being terran, and a
smuggler, she had a curious mind.  She explored each planet within
the ‘Pocket-system’ and discovered that most of the planets were
habitable.  This is unusual, as most systems only have one, and more
rarely two, that are habitable.  Her crew consisted of a varitable
mix of different interstellar races.  At the time, they knew no way
of escaping the ‘Pocket’, so they set out to populate the worlds and
make this galaxy their own.

Description :

Hi All, 

Just a little notice..... I decided to bring back the old cotn. I 
wasnt thinking clearly when i decided to abandon my code and go to a 
new codebase, so i brought the old cotn back up after 2 or 3 weeks of 
a new codebase with some modifications made to that. 

CotN has 13 base classes, and 20 hybrids. When i started my mud with 
a stock Dystopia 1.2.7 i deleted Shapeshifter, Samurai, Monk among 
others in order to use some custom classes without having about 40 
base classes in the end. 

Cotn is under heavy construction, 3 weeks ago when i decided to 
switch to a stock mindcloud2 it had and still has some problems, but 
then i was coding it alone, and had been for about 2 months and was 
overwhelmed. Its a hard codebase to run by myself and at the time i 
more or less gave up and decided to start with something stock. But i 
decided 2 days ago that since i put 1000 hours into the old one in 5 
months it was a foolish mistake to give up on it and not put in some 
long days and get it balanced and get everything working properly. 

There are currently two other coders on cotn and things are moving at 
a pretty good pace. 

It is little after midnight, on March 31st, and at this point there 
have been 795 pfiles made by the pbase... That is since March 29th. 
The place needs work, but more gets fixed every day, and there isnt 
that much left to have the place be in good running order before i 
can start on new things. By not that much left i mean about a week or 
so of work or less and it should be pretty balanced and stable. 

A Hybrid on my mud is simply a class that has all the powers of two 
other classes. Necromancer for example, has All the powers of Undead 
Knight and Elemental. Also Necromancer has All the Modifiers of both 
classes. So that means the combined Damcap, Parry, Resistance, Dodge, 
Damage Modifiers etc of both classes. So two base classes with good 
melee would make a great melee based hybrid, but a hybrid with both 
of its corresponding base classes being poor melee classes would have 
poor melee for a hybrid. But it works itself out. (the hybrid with 
poor melee would have the all the powers of the 2 bases that made it 
good with its poor melee) In order to balance hybrids i only have to 
balance base classes, because everything hybrid related is directly 
affected by any change made to one of its base classes. 

The process of becoming a hybrid is.... First you selfclass one of 
the two classes required to become a hybrid. Then you get that base 
class to 5 status and remort into your second class. When you remort 
you lose everything from the first class. After you get your second 
class to 5 status you can then Fuse into a Hybrid. 

In the Early days of cotn, a friend wrote the fight system on my mud 
which is soly used here. Hits go to body parts, such as wrist, or 
right ear, or shin, or knee, elbow, neck etc.. in some cases there
are several body parts per Wear Location.. So 'Body' for example as  
chest, might have ribs, stomach, chest, etc And if a hit went to one 
of the body parts for the Chestplate piece of armor its damage would 
be reduced if armor was worn there, with a chance to damage that 
armor. if no armor worn there than more damage. Also some locations 
take more damage. Neck has throat for example, if you are hit there 
you would take more damage than your knee. There are rom like damage 
messages instead of the Stock Dystopia ones. 

This Notice of the old cotn being back is rapidly growing long so i 
will end here. Stop by and check the place out if you feel so 
inclined, cotn.wolfpaw.net port 4600

Take New York City, bright with lights and celebrities. Take teams of 
superheroes with astounding abilities who save the world 
spectacularly on a regular basis, some of whom call that famous city 
home. Would you feel lucky to be part of such a world? 

Now send the superheroes off on their missions and turn away from 
the neon and glitz. Take the city and rub it with grit. Take 
superpowered people and turn them into criminals and vigilantes 
who work the city's streets. Take a media mass who can't tell the 
difference between the two, liable to label someone a menace 
because they don't like the colour of his tights. Take everyday cops, 
agents and investigators and send them in to sort out the mess of 
crime and violence on the streets. Lace it with a thriving criminal 
underworld, corruption, blackmail, theft, murder, and people just 
trying to live their lives. Still feel lucky?

Sprinkle the result with a few stubborn individuals who just can't 
stay home at night while the city chews on itself. These heroes 
aren't trying to save the world; rather they're trying to save the 
people who live in it.

They are the Marvel Knights, and they want you to come play with 
them.

Marvel Knights MUX focuses on the NYC-based titles of the Marvel 
Knights imprint - Daredevil, the Punisher, Spider-Man, and the 
like. There are plenty of FCs available and OCs are always welcome.

throw in bonuses for early players. 

The reason its called Sarith's Revenge is 'cause Sarith is my

changes are made possible through room progs and custom code.
 
A personal spirit helps the novice mudder learn their way around,
so being a newbie on PoopMud is not so daunting for the novice.
Immortals and Elders are available to answer questions and give
suggestions in order to help the novice mudder develop into a
fully experienced player. A togglable hints channel gives the
new player suggestions of useful information.
 
At level 50, players may choose either a secondary class or the
same class, to create either an expert or a more diverse
character. Once reaching level 50 with the secondary class,
statistics may be improved via the meta shop.
 
A functioning arena is available for controlled PK games.  There
are over 100 automatic quests, plus imm-led quests. Quest Points
earned can be used to buy Orbs and powerful scrolls and potions.
 
The Well contains 20 levels of over 6000 randomly
generated rooms and mobs. The mobs in The Well have fragments,
which can be used to gain a super race called K'ta'viir (KTV).
 
All in all, PoopMud is an enjoyable place to come forget the
frustrations of every day life. Come join us!

Telnet      : dbna.wolfpaw.net 3000 [204.209.44.13]
WWW         : http://dbs.digitdreams.com/dbna/
Description :

   Dragonball A New Age is exactly what the title describes, being
that our mud is on the track of being a unique dragonball smaug
based mud that stands out amongst the others.  While we still are in
need of a coder or two, DBNA has a full staff committed to their
areas of expertise and willing to help the player base with any
questions they may have.  Even though we started not to long ago,
New Age does have plans for the future. On top of areas and coding
already implemented, some examples of new ideas to come would
include:

New areas: The Dead Zone, The Tree of Might, The Worlds Strongest,   
           Castle Vegeta, Soltari Desert, Frieza's Ship, The Hive
           (areas are focused on all powerlevel and skill ranges).

Upcoming Areas: North City, Various Afterlife Kai Planets (north,
                South, East, West), Planet of the kai's,Shadow Earth.

Super Mobs: Shadow Dragons, Garlic Sr, Dabura, The Many Forms of Buu,
            Beibei

New coding: Additional Races: Kaio's, Demons, Android h,e,fm, (Test
            race Genie).  Fusion is available and a new type of 
            namekian fusion.  Androids are getting a haul over with 
            their chips, being a Chip Integration that our coder Karn
            is adding.

Quests:  A innovative member of our staff will be on hand to take 
         ideas from the players and designs himself.  Focuses will 
         reside on offering multiple side quests and events to 
         combind the entire player base so everyone will be involved.
         Some quests implemented now include:
         *New Age World Martial Arts Tournament
         *Tag
         *Treasure Hunt
         *Drunken Race
         *Lotto
         *Chaos Day
         *Fringing
         *Key Pursuit


Clans:   Clans are added for a more divided feel amongst rivals and 
         unification for friends.

Another supplementary idea that will be put into action is a form of
wishing involving the seven dragon balls.

This is only a taste of what is to come of Dragonball A New Age. 
Our current members are newbie friendly and willing to help people
in need.  So head over to Dragonball A New Age and bring a friend if
you would like and live your own dragonball escapade.

Description :

What does an egocentric scientific genius of the galaxy do when she
is bored with the same old lab tests and experiments?  Simple; she
goes out into the various realities and steals people like the alien
abductions you've read about in tabloids and brings them into a
simulated world environment in one of her sub-space labs.  She
doesn't stop there though.  To make things really interesting she
strips all her victims of their memories and replaces them with all
new ones then drops them into her simulated world environment, Here
is Greenwood.  She then assumes the role of Dean and joins the fun,
observing first hand how her changes effect the people in her
experiment.  It's something to do, right?  ^A^  ^B^

Here is Greenwood is run sort of like the 'Truman Show' except on a
grander scale.  There is only one viewer, Washuu-sama with multiple
'Stars' of the show, you.  It is a humor based enviroment that throws
many elemnents of your favorite anime high school shows together into
a melting pot of insanity.  High school will never be the same again.

Full detailed information regarding the game world and applying for a
character can be found at the Here is Greenwood Muck website.  What
are you waiting for?  Grab some pencils and paper and get moving!

Description :

The Seven Kingdoms...
...where summers last years and winters can last decades,
...where a sworn knight can be a traitor, and a commoner a hero,
...where the tourney grounds rumble to the sound of knights' chargers,
...where a Targaryen king sits the Iron Throne, and some strive to 
     protect him, while others plot the end of his reign,
...where the southron bow to the seven faces of god, while the 
     northern lords worship older, nameless powers,
...where far to the north criminals walk side by side with knights 
     on a seven-hundred-foot ice Wall, sworn to guard the realms 
     of men against the onset of the cold, and beyond the Wall, 
     the powers of night gather,
...where each great house struggles to gain advantage in the only 
     game, the game of thrones,
...where you play or you die.
Because the cold winds are rising, and, as the Starks say,
Winter is coming.
Seven Kingdoms is a MUD based on the Song of Ice and Fire books by
George R. R. Martin. Knowledge of the books is not required to play 
the game, but it may enhance your experience.

The MUD contains an extensive House system and organizations such 
as the Night's Watch, which are for the most part player-run. 
Roleplaying is strongly encouraged.

Most of our code is original. We have a completely custom combat 
system, which includes features not available on any other MUD. 
Our players have called us one of the most player-friendly MUDs 
in existence. 

We are currently open for player testing.

in participating in the birth of an originally themed MUSH riding 
on a codebase not in use anywhere else on the 'net.

Even if you're not interested in helping with the staff, you'll 
be welcomed if you stop by to ask any questions you may have, and 
find an OOC area in place where you can hang out and interact.

When the time rolls around for Hostile Galaxies to go IC and 
accept players, it will be posted in the description. Contact the

kingdom hall.
  *Original ideas are constantly implemented.

Shades of Grey is a World of Darkness mush set in Ketchikan,
Alaska. At this moment we are open for soft Roleplay without TPs,
until all the needed code to support all kinds of roleplay has been 
set up in a few weeks. We are a starting mush, looking for lower
level characters of mostly mortals, shifters and vampires. Other
races might be welcome but would need discussion with staff.

We are an experimental mush in that we have a cooperative system,
instead of the much more widely used competitive system. However,
despite using a cooperative system, staff will keep an active hand in
keeping the flavor and the dangers of living in the World of
Darkness a threatening and challenging place. We are going to try to
stress the roleplay side of things more than the dice-rolling side, 
to be a place open to intersphere roleplay and different 
interpretations of the WoD system, and a heavy stress on non-linear 
storylines.

If you want to know more, feel free to come take a look at
Shadesofgrey.wolfpaw.net port 2828 and feel free to ask any staff
online any questions you might have!

Tower Guard, a Warder, bonded to an Aes Sedai, a black-veiled Aiel man, 
a member of the Band of the Red Hand, a Gleeman, entertaining the 
masses, a Defender of the Stone. An Illian Companion, a hardy Blight 
Guard, or a proud Queen's Guard. Maybe a dreaded Darkfriend, serving the 
Shadow, or even an Asha'man, wielding the One Power in service to the 
Dragon Reborn.We offer a unique family orientated environment where 
people of all ages can enjoy escaping the troubles of the real world. 
POTP-MUD utilizes a heavy modified code base which is an offshoot of the 
AWW code base. Our creation process is so newbie friendly that you are 
actually learning how to play while you are making your first character. 
The staff is comprised of a multi-tiered system geared towards assisting 
the players.

Description :

Darkened Lights Codebase was originally thought 
up by Mayhem, with his love of godwars, and 
loyalty to the circlemud codebase, he single handedly 
gave way in a groundbreaking effort to produce the 
first Godwars/CircleMUD style codebase. 
first I would like to say that CircleMUD leveling system 
still exist in this mud, I wanted to give the impression that 
killing other players isn't the only objective to this mud.
With the long and hard struggle for perfection, the 
MUD dynamics of Darkened Lights, have far surpassed 
what godwars can create.
 
Seeing as it maybe that godwars 
has a pretty flimsy code structure, I then decided 
to create a godwars style unparallel, 
to the impervious Godwars dynamics. 
Although the muds basic functions are still common 
the actual code is a bit more stable than godwars, 
and always different. Right now we are in a beta testing 
format but where always open and your character will 
never get deleted. Darkened Lights is now hirering

Description :

It is the fall term of 1998. Harry and friends have graduated from
Hogwarts. Their seventh year was an exciting one as, apparently 
Dumbledore has managed to defeat Voldemort and saved the magical 
and muggle worlds from his horrible plottings.

No one knows what took place during the final showdown between these 
two.. the only thing that IS known is that Dumbledore somehow forced 
Voldemort beyond the veil.. and in the process of this happening, 
Sirius has returned to this realm.

Most are rejoicing but many realize that it's not really over. The 
prophecy was very very specific. Harry Potter would bring about the 
downfall of the Dark Lord. The end has not come.. but is merely 
delayed. And the fact that Sirius was able to come back through the 
veil only points even more directly to this.. after all if he was 
able.. what will stop Voldemort.

There are additional concerns for Harry and those close to him. While 
Sirius is back in this world, he is still in canine form and appears 
to have forgotten that he can change. No one is able to ascertain the 
cause of this, and it is hoped that time will bring back his memory 
and cause him to return to human form.

For the time being, Harry has returned to Hogwarts, accompanied by 
his four footed companion. He will be acting as assistant to 
Professor Lupin in Defence against the Dark Arts as well as helping 
Madam Hooch with Quidditch and flying lessons. Hermione is also back, 
working as assistant in Arithmancy.

Be that as it may the new school term has begun and students are
looking forward to seeing what it will bring.

Description :

-* Kormar mud is ran by ex-duris immortals. A small creation
that broke the ground of traditional MUDs. Kormar mud boasts
an incredible immortal staff with the passion for gaming  
Now with improved code and playability Kormar is back and 
live. Kormar Mud spawns from a list of games that stretch 
from Toril,Duris,Sojourn, and Basternae I. Now with completely 
re-written code and with a staff who listens, Kormar Mud is 
ready to rock.

-* Kormar is locked in an eternal battle between three race 
sides. The Surface Dwellers, The UnderDark Denizens, and
the mind controlling Illithids (Coming soon!)

-* Each side has it's own original fully viewable ASCII 
map in real time. You can run after your enemy on the maps, 
find new zones, climb mountains to avoid being caught, and 
even see when other NPC's are wandering the map.

-* The mud has bountiful classes from warriors to rangers 
to sorcerers to even illusionists. All with original 
spells/skills.

-* The zones are completely original and new ones are 
discovered every day. Kormar mud can boast a full 200
plus zones!

-* Kormar Mud is a FULL PvP mud. The underlying story, 
and playability revolves around PvP. This mud caters to 
PvPcentric players, but, has stunning zones for the zoner. 
A unique part of Kormar is the zone changes. IE: You could 
be in a human town during the day that just doesn't seem right, 
once night time comes, you begin to notice shrieks in the 
distance, and this is when the vampires/beasts of the night 
have come to feast.

-* Kormar Mud is for people who are looking for a challenge 
in a generally stagnant hack and slash Mudding experience. 
Don't be afraid to log in and ask the IMMs any questions.

Cheers and Happy Mudding!

Description :

Manga Nation is derived from the ROM style of muds with a
theme mostly based on Anime/Manga (Japanese animation) with
some various other forms of fantasy theme mixed in as per
requests from the history of player input.

The race AND class systems are set up in trees of "evolutions".
Each tree has an unknown number of branches, as we like there
to be some suprise and mystery involved with the vast evolution
system.

With over 50 races, over 70 classes, and over 2000 skills and
spells, we are still a growing community.  Additions and
editing are performed on a daily basis, and player feedback
is highly encouraged and rewarded.  About 95% of
player-submitted ideas are implemented, so the growth and
success of the MUD is largely in thanks to you, the player.

If you have any questions, complaints, suggestions, or ideas,
please, let us know, player feedback is what builds our world
and keeps it living.

Before the hosting problems this past year, we were averaging
up to 60 players at any given time in a day.  I know a few of
have been missing "home" here and haven't been able to find the
IP, so here ya go.

For you older players, welcome back, things have only been
getting better.  To you new players out there, check us out,
there are things here that haven't been tried or accomplished
at other places, we've made wonderful coding breakthroughs.
Oh, and the population is friendly and helpful, so you'll make
friends fast.

Description :

Enter the Legends of Ragnarok. You find yourself in another world enthralled
in a world of true fantasy. Many adventures await as you complete quests,
battle your enemies and gain experience to become a master of your trade.

You begin your journey in Udgard as a member of one of the four guilds of
the town. Depending on your play-style and intended usage of your character,
you may choose from being a warrior, cleric, thief, or a magic user. In
these guilds you learn the tools of your trade from weapon usage to spells.
Your guild is also where you practice your abilities, however there is no
such stat as hit points as some of you are used to. Instead, Ragnarok bases
your hit points on the constitution of your character and your character's
racial modifier.

There are four races to choose from and depending on the race that you've
picked, your hit points are modified accordingly. Your race also determines
what percentage of an stat you can practice, which includes some races being
able to practice more than one hundred per cent of a stat. Be cautious
though, when spending these points you get only get a limited amount of
ability points which are spread out over your first fifty levels. Dont waste
them!
You may also leave the guild you are in and enter one of the other guilds in
Udgaard. Upon reaching level one hundred you may leave your base guilds and
enter one of the five more specialized final guilds. These include Sorcerer,
Necromancer, Assassin, Druids of Rohan, and Knights of the Rose. The
administration behind Ragnarok has used their experience as players to
provide you with an extensive world that you may easily become immersed in.
Some of you may recognize some of the areas but many have been added to
enhance your playing experience.

Don't miss your chance to be part of something new as Legends of Ragnarok
evolves. Sit through the newbie tour, keep up on the news, read the boards,
and register on the web site. You'll be glad you did.

WWW         : http://www.lotusempire.com
Description :

<i>Upon the death of Emperor Kishoku, the Lotus Empire was
plunged into civil war as samurai loyal to his daughter
and those loyal to a distant male imperial cousin clashed
on the field of battle.  The war ended with many thousands 
dead and the girl's partisans triumphant.  Since her
accession as empress, the roads have been dangerous and 
trade disrupted by the peril.  The people shocked by the 
war have flocked to the pacifist Laharti faith, which grows 
in official influence though it has not yet supplanted the
native Kamutsu religion.  Knights loyal to the empress' 
rival have been banished into exile, and their households 
scattered, while performers and merchants alike find life 
difficult as little money changes hands in these hard times.</i>

The Empire of the Blue Lotus takes place in a world setting 
roughly based on historical Asia, covering a variety of 
cultures and eras along with fantasy elements gathered 
together to form our world, which is its own.

The MUD is an RPI (role-play intense) MUD, classless and 
leveless.  All interaction through in character means is 
expected to remain in character.  However, out of 
character channels and means of communication are available 
as well for general chatting.  

We are currently in an alpha testing state, with 
role-play supported and rewarded automatically by the code, 
but many other features still in development.  We boast a 
wholly static MUD with dynamic descriptions for all mobs, 
objects, and rooms, as well as emoted combat code.

throughout the years, though the MUCK will always remain multi-themed.
The current themes are:

Alaska - Set in the area around Nome in the 1920s (around the time of
the diptheria epidemic), the Alaskan realm is the place to find sled
dogs, mushers, wolf packs, lush forests, flappers, questionable
taverns, and plenty of snow. Also featured here are the characters
from the movie Balto, which you can apply for and role-play yourself.

New York - Set in modern-day times, New York is just as you
would expect it - covered in smog, swarming with people and cars,
and filled with the filthiest of creatures, human and animal alike.
Cats and dogs are often found warring over territories and survival,
beggars and thieves are found on every corner, and even the zoo's
lions seem to be at each other's throats. Yet something about the
city keeps bringing in more tourists by the dozen - like moths
being drawn to a streetlight.

AmericanBrutus is the officially authorized sister MUD to 
CzechBrutus, a very popular MUD.  We are just restarting after about 
a year of being inactive due to server issues.  The followin 
description of the MUD is borrowed from Czech Brutus.

BrutusMUD offers 4 basic classes from the beginning, however at 
level 30 you specialize into one of 3 advanced classes (3 for each 
basic class), and after reaching level 60 you advance to legendary 
levels which offer new skills and spells and generally greatly 
enhances your character.  To reach 5th legendary level, you have to 
come through a special challenge, which will test your knowledge of 
your character, so only the best characters can reach 5th legenadry 
level.  Of course you have more than one attempt, but not an 
unlimitted amount.  Successfully completing the challenge opens 
whole new range of possibilities to advance your character far 
beyond the limits of lower legends.  But only few reach this 
status.  In the near future our remort engine will be complete, 
which will offer new possibilities!

added in the next few months as well as maintaining all the

take a look around, to let us see what they would like to have
in the mud. 

This game runs on the Fear 2.x engine that has nearly 7 years 
of work on it and includes a classless and levelless system 
that includes over 300 mostly custom and unique spells and 
skills over 5 different spheres.  Other such advantages of 
this system is randomly generated quests for you and your 
kingdom to run, a large wilderness map for everyone to enjoy
conquering, and the ability to hide your identity from others
through the usage of an introduction system.

We also include a pretty new gem system for upgrading your 
weapons and armor, as well as the old forge system that 
allows you to choose what type of weapons and armor you 
would like make. We have 23 different metals to use which 
can be found throughtout the mud and quest.

Fate of Ages is a MUD that is just starting to get on it's feet publicly,
having been in developmental stages for close to three years.  We have a
dedicated team of Coders, and this game has been their dream to do for a
long time.  Fate of Ages is a MUD with a strong emphasis on roleplay and
being able to immerse yourself in your character's world, and good RP is
rewarded.  As for skills, you will be able to start with your base class,
and then advancement beyond that is bought through skill groups.  This
allows for greater customization than the basic fighter, cleric, mage and
rogue classes allow.

Right now, FoA is entering alpha testing mode.  There will not be many
classes or races open to use, though more are in the works, and close to
being implemented.  We welcome any help, in the form of playtesting and,
if you're so inclined, building.

Thank you for your time, and we hope to see you in the world of Fate.

Code Base   : [Dawn] Modified Dawn 1.69r
Telnet      : forevermidnight.futurenext.org 4000
WWW         : http://forevermidnight.futurenext.org
Description :

Forever Midnight is a roleplaying mud currently being built, based on
a modified Dawn 1.69r codebase.  It has a unique fantasy/sci-fi theme
revolving around the storyline of three separate worlds - Earth,
Midnight Station, and Mars - which once coexisted, but were seperated
after a disaster.

The mud is in the process of being built.  However, it will feature a
unique and original world, with a focus on roleplaying.  There are no
stock areas on the mud currently, except for the Mud School and the
OOC area, and new areas are being built.

Your gameplay will change drastically depending on which of the three
races you choose - the Gaians, who have rediscovered latent 'magical'
powers after the disaster, but still live in a medieval style world;
the Noxians, who have mastered the arts of computer hacking and
technical prowess; and the Martians, founders of an almost utopian
society, with access to high-tech weaponry and skills.

Roleplaying will be highly encouraged on Forever Midnight, with
seperate 'government' systems in place for all three of the
civilizations.  The mud will also be newbie-friendly, with a large,
custom built mud-school.

The mud is currently open if you want to take a tour, and there are
plenty of resources on our homepage at forevermidnight.futurenext.org.
Stop by and see what we are all about!

is all original and is exactly like the series.
This mud takes place 25,000 years after DBGT,
but the only difference is everyone is still
alive. Goku and Vegeta how ever, have reached
Super Saiyan 6 and Gohan has reached his true
mystic potential. I admit it is kind of slow 
but it is still a good mud. We are also 
in desperate need of members to promote our

WWW         : http://vega.dyndns.org/~fireflymux/
Description :

 "After the Earth was used up, we found a new solar system 
and hundreds of new Earths were terraformed and colonized. 
The Central Planets formed the Alliance and decided all the 
planets had to join under their rule.


 There was some disagreement on that point.

 After the war, many of the Independents who had fought and lost
drifted to the edges of the system far from Alliance control. 
Out here, people struggle to get by with the most basic technologies. 
A ship would bring you work. A gun would help you keep it. A 
captain's goal was simple: Find a crew, find a job. Keep flying."

  When Firefly first aired in 2002, Joss Whedon painted gritty, 
realistic world based in the  26th century - a rich, colourful 
and diverse civilization five hundred years in the future. With the 
intriguing genre of 'space western' tied to its name, it brings up 
combined images of spaceships and horses, high technology and the 
old frontier, corrupt government and gunfights. Overall, it's about 
people ... their freedom and survival. Today, this world provides 
us with a unique opportunity for roleplay. It provides us with 
FireflyMUX.

  The game picks up where the television series left off after 
fourteen episodes; from hereon out, everything is non-canon, with 
a strong backbone of that canon flavour we know and love. 
FireflyMUX is a realistic roleplay reflection of the Firefly 
theme as created by the one and only Joss Whedon; as such, we strive
to fit into his vision as best we can. Of course, there's plenty 
of room for originality – it's a big universe!

- We're now open for beta-testing after a long time of 
preparation. Although in preliminary stages, we're fullly 
functional and absolutely open for applications and roleplay, 
so come visit us!

Code Base   : [Rom] Bare Traces Remaining
Telnet      : eod.genesismuds.com 7200
WWW         : http://
Description :

First things First this mud IS not complete. I've dedicated 
hours into the codebase so far, but i haven't had the 
nessecary builders to complete it. 

Eon of Darkness is NOT an adult oriented mud. We welcome 
players of ALL ages, as well as welcome players who want 
to be able to mud without feeling intimidated by other 
players harrassment/cussing. (And we WILL enforce the 
language rules over public channels). This mud is also 
intended for players who want to be able to play when THEY 
have time. If you leave for a little while, so be it, just 
don't leave if your in a position of power (example: 
president). When you come back you'll still be able to 
maintain your combatative ability.

Anyways, Eon of Darkness is a Hack and Slash clone. Our 
skills are ALL based off Skill level not skill percent. 
This means that the higher your level the higher the 
effect, not the higher the chance for the skill to actually 
work.... Also combat is speed based, and armor actually 
reduces damage instead of just lowering the chance to be 
hit. Our combat system also utilizes a resist system of 7 
types of magic. 

Our class system contains:
Fighters: Barbarian, Monk, Paladin, Assassin
Magic:    Druid, Mage, Necromancer

As the mud evolves i will slowly implement a politics
system. This means that players can elect a president 
to rule their Nation... the president can then declare 
war, peace, alliances, etc on other nations. 
(Essentially its a complicated Clan system). The bonus 
to this system is, each nation will contain its own 
Capitol city, as well as mobs to guard it, attack other 
cities, police crimes etc...

Our movement system is based off of an ascii map. If you 
don't like mapping... :(, sorry guys. But I'm trying to 
make this a hack and slash mud.

a version of his MUD.

The theme of EmpireMUD takes place in the Dark Ages 
and revolves aroundthe players' efforts to construct 
an empire by physically building an array of 
structures from storage buildings to castles and also
populating their empires with other players.  The 
MUD's environment is also based on Role-Play, more 
specifically the rules of White-Wolf RPGs.  Experience 
is awarded to players who RP their characters expertly 
and thus are able to advance their characters.  For

It has been three years since Sailor Moon decided it would be the 
best idea to remove the presence of the Senshi and their powerful,
world shaping, influence over the people of Earth. She did this in 
a last ditch effort to avoid nine hundred years of sleep in a 
frozen world. She longed to live her life in the here and now. 
In the blink of an eye, the world was forever changed. The Senshi
ripped from the memories of the world as a whole. But in their 
place the few remaining Magical Girls, still fought.
         Sakura Kinomoto had sealed and changed all the Clow Cards
into Sakura Cards. She was their true mistress now. She thought at
last she would have peace. She thought perhaps she would be allowed
to be normal. She was wrong. She was readying to leave for college
and the presence came to her. Dark and sickly. She decided at that
moment, to pack her cards, she knew she would need them.
        These are just two of the three series we offer at Magical
Destiny: The College Years. Sailor Moon, Card Captor Sakura, and
Tokyo Mew Mew (Mew Mew Power: US) have been aged and deaged to fit
 in to a year one ortwo college setting. We are an Anime Only type
game which is designed for Mature RPers. We use a slightly
modified BESM 2nd edition game system with a fully online character
generation system. We have a small grid designed to allow players
to always find RP in and around the college setting.
        The most unique feature of our game however, is the 
community. We are a very friendly bunch who enjoy having fun and 
want to have fun. We are mature adults and we seek to bring a great
 game with a mature Anime Game. We expect everyone to be mature.
        Right now we are starting to take claims on FCs for our
initial soft opening. Come by and talk to us, we'll help you find
something that suits you.

between the mortals and immortals. The immortals have a wide range of
skills and constantly work to improve the realm and enhance roleplay.
 
The world is largely original. and new areas are constantly being
worked on. We have everything from an extensive desert with pyramids
to an underwater area with mermaids. There are several racial
hometowns such as the Dwarven Kingdom, Menzoberrananzan (drow), and
Galioldor (elves), and more. There are a few specialized areas such
as Stupid World where players can blow off steam and grab a few
Smurfberries or go speak to the King of Florin!
 
There are nine classes with skills and spells for each of those
classes. Players can choose to be anything from a mage that can
cast a rain of fire upon their enemy or a druid who uses the
specially created skill of herbalism to make poultices.
 
We have a wide variety of races and a select group of remort
only races. Some of the races include thrikreen, elf, drow,
faerie, feylar, vampire, werewolf and others. Remort only races
angel, lich, golem, dragon, and demon.
 
Roleplay is required, and player-killing is limited. You must have
supporting roleplay to kill another player! However, you may decide to
not participate in player-killing and roleplay your character
accordingly. Roleplay possibilites are endless here at WOTL. You can
own a shop and sell wares, be a vampire hunter, be a playwrite, and
more.

you!

the MUD is protected from crashes by a system that catches it and
safely reboots the MUD whilst saving data.

Description :

  Legions of Chaos is the continuation of the popular
Static Chaos/Chaosium codebase originally created by Alathon.

This mud offers 5 classes:
Fist      : Human warriors who harness the power of their
            spirit.
Mazoku    : Demonic astral beings who feed on mortal emotions.
Patryn    : Demihuman masters of rune magic.
Saiyan    : A race of warriors with tremendous innate
            strength.
Sorcerer  : Human mystics who wield the three schools of
            magic.

We are extremely stable, and are slowly moving away from the roots
of Static Chaos, all we need now are players.
If you played Static Chaos AKA Chaosium, and want to play
it some more than come by Legions of Chaos, and 
prepare to succum to your new addiction.

And yes, I know this is the RoW description, don't bug me about it,
when I get time, I will write a more detailed one.

Description :

You are in a laboratory in the midst of Nevada, where unknown
experiments take place. Rumours from the nearest cities tell of vulgar
experiments involving sexual depravity, such as civilised people have
never dreamed of.

The lab itself is self funding, a free flow of information is provided
to its sister research centres, and is founded on land now deemed as
international. Here, the laws are made by the senior administration of
the laboratory, and summary execution is also permitted.  The main
premise of the lab is to advance the human understanding of life, and
has military backup when required, courtesy of Area 51, to which the
labs staff are the only civilian organisation allowed access. As such,
humans, and often aliens, are quite common in equal measure, though
some 'aliens' are merely genetically modified human life-forms.

One common element of this lab, is that, although the place is
guarded, anyone is free to step up to the building and enter, though
from eye-witness reports, nothing, and no-one EVER comes out, not
even in a box. This is because, in an effort to protect both the
general populace, and to prevent information leaks, any escapee is
promptly killed on sight, by one of the many automated weapons
systems, hidden around the grounds.

Description :

The Third Tribulation is a roleplay-enforced fantasy MUD based in a
completely original world.  Featuring a rich 'good versus evil' 
storyline, characters have the opportunity to shape history by
participating in grander conflicts or, if they so choose, live their
own lives with little regard for the events unfolding around them.

Features of The Third Tribulation include:

- A roleplay-enforced environment.
- A highly polished world and codebase with mature administration.
- Seven classes and nine races tentatively planned.
- A unique twist on the traditional ROM class system, resulting in
  variety between characters of the same class without being
  excessively complicated.
- Absolutely no stock ROM areas, skills, or spells.
- Balanced game mechanics for RP-related player killing.

Presently, The Third Tribulation is in the middle of alpha
development, and we are looking for builders willing to help us out.
Even if you have little or no experience using OLC, we are more than
willing to teach; however, because the MUD is aimed towards
roleplayers, maturity and a firm grasp of the English language are a
must in order to sculpt quality areas that will foster roleplay.  If
you are interested, please stop by and ask about building or visit
our website for more information.

2005's Caer Dubrin is a mud that, despite being 4 years old, is still
in beta phase. However the code offers very unique features to
players. This includes a learning system based on spheres, which are
set depending on what race, guild, and god you choose. That is another
thing we use, a system based little on the 5 classes (all they do is
determine what guilds you can join), but entirely on the combination
of race/guild/god you choose. We also make use of DG Scripts,
including automatic quests using the scripts. None of these are
implemented as yet, because in addition to the code being in a beta
state the world is still being built. We also offer an extended remort
system with 50 total remorts. The first 30 remorts are considered

Mud         : Divine Providence
Code Base   : [Circlemud] Modified
Telnet      : slayn.net 8888 [209.172.37.19]
WWW         : http://
Description :

Divine Providence is a very new MUD but already very far coding 
wise.  And for those of you that want to read the background story..
here's a rough draft:

   The beginning was a time of upheaval.  The world was a chaotic
void filled only by the forces of the universe that ran unchecked by
the divine powers.  The gods grew tired of their turbulent reality
and sought a way to bring order to the world.  And so the elemental
stones were forged from the powers of nothingness.  Each devoured
the powers of its element and kept them locked away.  But the world
was now darkness and the gods sought something more to fill the
void, so they drew forth the stones to create a new world.
   The power of the stones gave birth to a world of balance; a heart
of fire and a cooling essence of water, the expanse of sky and the
solid earth, a burning light and the chill of shadows.  The gods
rejoiced, for there was at last peace.  But the gods were not happy,
for the world was empty.  They created the races of the world and
spread them across the world, but the world remained still.  Rivers
remained still and calm, and the wind failed to blow, for there was
nothing to guide them.  So the gods delved into the mixed essence of
the world and bound the elemental stones to it.  At once the world
began to move, set into motion by the magical powers of the universe.
   The creatures of the world began to thrive and created towns and
then cities.  Gatherings of people gave rise to culture.  The gods
watched the creation of music and art with pride and happiness, and
saw that this new world was good.  So they bestowed magic upon the
world as a gift for being so perfect.
   But this gift came with knowledge, the wisdom of the true nature
of the worlds and a power that even the gods could barely keep in
check.  A legend was born in this time: A mortal who controlled the
stones would control the earth, and rival the gods themselves.  The
righteous citizens of the world erected temples to protect the
stones and countless wars were fought for control over these shrines.
   It was during the last of these wars that Debaqual, the great
necromancer, used his dark magic and threachery to set the peoples
of the world against each other.  In the following turmoil he stole
the six elemental stones and performed a legendary rite to achieve
immortality.  Debaqual's ascendance was cut short as the gods
themselves reappeared to strike down the new god.  And then the Old
Times ended.
   The Time of Chaos began.
   For Debaqual's ritual was completed even as the gods struck the
fatal blow, but the world was torn asunder by the very forces that
had created it.  The powers of the universe lashed out at the gods
and they faded from sight.  And as the Great Necromancer lay dying,
his half divine wisdom brought the truth to his mind.
   The legend had been incomplete.  The sages of the past had lied
to protect the world from a new, terrible god.  For there was one
last stone, that of the power of Nature, and it protected the one
last sanctuary to civilized life in the now chaotic world: Kikora,
also known as the Divine Providence. 
   But now that the truth is known, will the world remain in chaos? 
Will balance be restored?  Or will a new deity emerge from the chaos
to claim the world as their own?
   And the spirit of Debaqual wanders the world, tortured in unlife
as it seeks to finish its quest.

they grew jealous of each other, splitting the world in two.  
   Expanding their powers they empowered mere mortals with immortal
powers to aid in thier cause.  In the great climax of the War of
Brothers, each brother was slain by the other.  
   Saddend by his loss, the Creator abandoned Andramidos.  Foraken, 
the immortals of Andramidos vied for power and the war continues.  
   Now, centuries later, the war still raging, a group of people have 
branched off the two sides.  Headed by Majesta, God of Knowledge, 
Magic and Wisdom, they seek to maintain a balance, and end the 
bloodshed, while the forces of good and evil continue to clash in a 
war that has continued since the dawning of time.  
   The time has now come for you to go and shape history.  Join a 
side.  End the war.  Win the war.  Change the world, make the world 
of Andramidos what you will!


   Andramidos is currently in an Alpha Stage.  We are looking for
builders to expand the world.  Codebase is constantly getting updated 
and user wants are welcome and have a good possibility of getting 
added.  With over 250 spells planned we welcome any new ideas.
   Builders who would like a lot of room to build what you want are 
encouraged to contact the Majesta at the admin email address.  Novice 
or experienced.
   Players are welcome to create a character, run around and test 
things and post ideas on the board and help shape this mud to what 
the people want.

and you can either choose to in the protection of the 
world, destruction of the world or just stay neutral. 
The storyline can be found at the old website

We are currently in the process of porting over our 
existing areas that are completed and modding the 
codebase to how we want want it. We are currently 
still coding and building so any help would be most 
useful, experience or no experience in building it 
doesnt matter we will teach from scratch if you are 
willing to learn. Coders if you know DoT codebase or

Description :

Primal Fear is a Godwars/Dystopia v1.2 type MUD. We offer
a mostly original world created by our awesome build team.
The game is based on PVP and PKing in order to gain power
from your god.

Currently we are revamping certain areas to give it that
special touch, but weekly and sometimes daily new 
additions are made, including but not limited to:
New Towns/Areas, Quests, Items and Monsters/Mobs.

A very large scale class/race revamping has been in the works for 
quite some time, and is nearing the end. We are planning on 
implimenting an (cross)evolution type class advancement to see 
how it works, but for now there are 22 classes available, 
with 24 total (The other 2 are being tweaked and recoded from 
scratch to ensure player fairness). Mostly all classes have 
been recoded to ensure player fairness, along with making 
what used to be useless class powers, into powers that work.

Along with the class system, the Tier system is still in place.
Which means with every player kill you get, you get stronger.

Primal Fear is not for the weak hearted though, it is
definately R if not NC-17 rated material. If you are easily
offended then this MUD is not for you. If you hate when
you die or are killed by another player and complain about it,
this MUD is not for you. 

If you enjoy running around with a bunch of people with like minds
who don't have a problem expressing themselves, enjoy the 
senseless slaughter of npcs along with those of your PCs,
and enjoy gaining power and thus respect doing so,
then this MUD definately IS for YOU.

X-Men Evolution II MOO is set just after the end of the X-Men
 Evolution cartoon series.  When the credits roll on the end of the
 last episode, that's where we start!  That gives plenty of history
 to all the characters and to the world in which the characters live
 for everyone to role play in.  FC's and OC's alike are welcome on
 the game and an easy application encourages new ideas.

So far, there has been a Sentinel attack, exposing mutants to the
 world.  While there is some further acceptance than initially,
 humans still fear and loathe mutants on a whole.  

Raven Darkholme, aka Mystique, is no longer principle of Bayville
 High.  After losing the fight with Storm, and not being chosen to
 join Magneto on Asteroid M to go through his device which was
 supposed to bring mutants to their full potential, she snuck up
 herself, and got caught in the machine.  However, she maintained her
 presence at the school, in the form of Risty.  And though everyone
 thinks she was turned into stone to release Apocalypse, then broken
 into many pieces, she re-appears, her powers being amplified by
 Apocalypse, once he's released.

Xavier's Institute for Gifted Youngsters, along with the Brotherhood
 of (Evil) Mutants have been exposed as havens for mutantkind, and
 the X-Men not only helped to keep Magneto from realizing his plan of
 world domination, but they defeated Juggernaut, Xavier's
 half-brother, when he came in search of Xavier.

Everything that happened in the series, from start to finish, is the
 past as the game starts just at the rolling of the final credits on
 Ascension pt 2.  The show is the past, time for the future.

Stargate: Atlantis MUSH is based upon the popular TV series Stargate:
Atlantis, a spin-off from Stargate SG1.
It is currently in the last stages of development, and is seeking
additional builders to help apply the last touches to the grid before
we open for playtesting and RP-only play.

SG:A offers players an unique experience based on the series, yet 
setting itself apart after the conclusion of Season 1, and caters
both to players who wish only to RP and players that want to 
experience combat between the Wraith and the Pegasus galaxy's 
human population.

apply for a position on the building staff, either connect to 
the MUSH directly, or send a mail to the contact address provided.

Players will have options of many types of characters. 

From combatants, recon experts, scientists, and just about
 anything else that one can think of.

a very well-balanced, and enjoyable MUD. I have plans for a

class, rolling over his old skills from his last class. Then
a very detailed character creation system, to make your char
exactly how you want, character traits, and hometowns are
available. This MUD will be half-and-half of PK and RP. I
was brought up on a MUD of that mannor, so I find that mix
is perfect. Then there will be 12 classes, and 7 races. To
top it all, besides the system, I have a very well thought-up,
and interesting story for the MUD, which will be released soon.

Description :

I invite you to this 'proof of concept' MUD : Orfal's WRT54G MUD.

Address : orfal.game-host.org:4000
MUD-type: ROM (2.4)
Purpose : proof of concept

The reason for this MUD's existance is two-fold: 
test the possibility to run a full-blown MUD on cheap 
( < 100$) hardware with minimal powerconsumption and nominal speed.
Enhance the MUD and eventually release detailed instructions 
for any person to do this on his own (Linux-based) router.

Hardware on which the MUD is running : Linksys WRT-54G router 32Mb RAM
You read it right: this MUD runs on a Linksys router running Linux 2.4
(Sveasoft kernel), 32 Mb of RAM and a 200 Mhz MIPS-processor
- no harddrive.

The whole ROM MUD is therefore backed up regularly to remote storage.
In case the router is rebooted, the MUD is restored within 15 minutes
(backed up ever 30 minutes).

The MUD itself is very basic, and I hope you will give it a try
so I can see the real-world implications of running an embedded Linux
MUD :)

WWW         : http://
Description :

The Kanto Region, six years after Satoshi and his friends began their
journey. The entire region has been devastated by a 
massive brainwashing attack transmitted through all radio 
devices. Rocket Dan's shadow slowly began to slip across the
continent and take root, and Kanto began to become the heart 
of darkness. Returning to his home town to find all of the 
buildings razed to the ground and all of the inhabitants drained 
of their cognitive skills, Satoshi was distraught. He ran from 
city to city, forming a rag-tag band of Pokemon trainers that 
had survived the brainwashing, and fought furiously to delay 
the advances of Rocket Dan. Sadly, the resistance force was 
forced to fall back. The Kanto region is preparing for what 
could be the final battle. Johto and Hoenn are still free lands, 
but no one knows how long they will stay that way.

The storyline and technical details of Pocket Monsters: Dark 
Horizons adhere mostly to the Pokemon anime and games. We're 
presently running on PennMUSH version 1.8.0p4. We have an 
SSL-enabled port on 9010, and the MUSH is Pueblo-enhanced.

Currently, we are seeking enthusiastic individuals to fill 
the positions of TP staff, helping to finish describing the 
grid and helpstaff. As of this time, however, we are also 
opening up for those interested in playing at Pocket Monsters:
Dark Horizons to login, take a look around as a guest and to 
submit applications for characters. We're also gearing up for 
our opening TP.

Description :

That sting of the bite, the smell of blood in the air, that glow 
within the eyes of the beast before you .. is it so very real.  Your 
vision blurrs as you feel your body being drained of its essence, 
your very existance is now threatened .. you are dying .. this thing 
is draining you of your blood .. No, it can't be, this is just a 
dream, a nightmare.  The extascy of that dark kiss sends shivers 
throughout your body .. darkness is all that can be seen as you begin 
to fade .. fade into nothingness. You cannot let go, you will not 
die, you cannot give up and the haze clears if but for a moment...

A loud cry of pain, a screech.  You have to get out, you are not 
part of this.  This has to be a dream.  You struggle for life, to 
wake up, to make sense of such a thing.  The darkness becomes 
brightening, almost blinding.  Heaven calls you yet you ignore its 
call and as you finally begin to force yourself alive, those eyes 
open into soft slits revealing the scene at hand.

You are dead, this is one nightmare that you will never return from.  
This is the dark ages and the only truely release is in death.  This 
is not a game for the faint of heart, mature killing and otherwise 
mutiliations are common place.

Elysium Nights offers clans from WoD:DA Vampire as well as tribes 
from WoD:DA Werewolf.  This is mainly a avenue for roleplay in a hack 
and slash atmosphere sporting 100% original world built around a true 
to life midevil England.  Truely a unique and original gaming 
experience catering to both hardcore roleplayers and those who simply 
like to 'run around and kill stuff'.

But we're looking for Java coders and we welcome playtesters, or
anyone else who would like to come hang out and chat and help
contribute to our development.

Aelfengard is a fantasy RPG, offering the feel of a text-based MUD
combined with a rich custom client interface.

Some of our unique features:

* Anonymity system. Players don't have a registered name in the game
at all. You are who you introduce yourself as.

* Players never leave the world. When you log off, you go to sleep.
This means you're liable to run across real people in their inn
rooms, druids sleeping protected in their groves, wizards sleeping
under a protection spell in the wilderness, etc.

* Zero theft. If you earn equipment, you keep it, unless you want to
give it away.

* Artwork for every room adds ambience.

* Players can pick and choose facial parts to make a unique face for
their character. Millions of combinations are possible.

* Players can help build the world. A flexible room ownership system
allows for cities, houses, clan halls, and other areas to expand and
adapt without assistance from a builder or admin.

* Rich heads-up display provides a great user interface while keeping
screen scroll to a minimum.

Zeldafront RPG Stone: Live the Legend!
An online RPG made by-fans-for-fans and it's coming on the 1st
of May!

You can find the website (where you will be playing as well) at
http://www.zeldafront.com/!

If you wish to contact us, send an e-mail to atake@zeldafront.com.

Development took a long time, and a total of 7 staff members have
worked on it for a whole year. We have adjusted some things in
the original story, to make it suitable for a perfect MMORPG!

We used the atmosphere and world of Zelda, and adjusted it so
everyone can play in it. This time, there won’t be just one or
two storylines, there will be hundreds! And you can influence them
all as a player!It all takes place in Hyrule, the Hyrule that
starred in Ocarina of Time.

This MMORPG isn’t just a normal game, it’s text-based.
Meaning you get all the freedom you can get, and you can have your
own character, in it’s own quest for it’s own goal. You write
what you (=your character) does.

Everything is interactive, since you decide what you do and what
happens. Of course there are some rules,to make sure things
won’t get out of hand.

Players will have many things to do, such as just becoming a
great warrior, or living in Kakariko Village as a carpenter. Or you
could try to find a girlfriend and spend romantic evenings watching
the stars above Lake Hylia, or...
well, just think of somethingyourself!

The regular and special Events are great fun for the players,
and they can –sometimes- even earn a special item or other rewards.
In this game you don’t just play to become strong, and there is
no final ending. It’s about living your character’s life, and
reaching your goal.

We hope to attract many Zelda fans from all around the globe,
and offer them the ultimate Zelda experience.

Zeldafront RPG Stone: Live the Legend!
    * Fast server, quick connection
    * Shops with all of the items you had in Ocarina of Time.
    * Simple-to-use – easy-to-understand RP System.
    * Meet other players and start your epic adventures together!
    * Almost total freedom in what you do with your character.
    * Assistance is available 24/7!
    * Free!

Deryni Universe as put forth by Katherine Kurtz in
her most excellent series, The Deryni Chronicles.
The Eleven Kingdoms,where the story unfolds, is very similar
to our own Europe of the Middle Ages, and troubled by many
of the same issues. But the overall conflict is between 
Human and Deryni.

Deryni can do magick but Humans cannot.

The Deryni Race has been nearly decimated in Gwynedd. Gone
are all their once great centers of learning, their
religious orders that taught Healers and Scholars. After
two hundred years of persecution and near genocide, they
have diminished as a people, their once awesome powers
no longer used for the benefit of mankind, but merely for
survival.
DeryniMUSH is open to the public but still in development.
We're seeking staff of all kinds. If you are familiar with
our theme or like Medieval role-play, or know your way
around MUSHing, please contact Camber on the MUSH.

This is a
player-centric mud supported by innovative and interesting
economic, legal and ecological systems.  Players run guilds,
players operate stores, players set prices, and players
build structures throughout the world.

  That said, it is a challenging mud. It's tough at the
bottom as a newbie because this mud has unique and complicated
game play; established players won't just roll over and give
up their turf (or cash!).  Its also tough at the top with
Lords and Guild Leaders responsible for administrative and
legal decisions which maybe unpopular with lesser players.
This encourages an active and participative society.
If you take the time and effort to learn the mud you'll
find it unique and engrossing. Many of our 'hard core'
players have been active for over five years.

  There are many ways to 'play'; it's not a killfest, we
strongly encourage role players and a responsible community.
But it's also a tough simulation; so the traditional
'warrior' adventurer will find plenty to fulfill them.
You'll find 9 innovative races, 11 guilds, 32 quests, like
you've never seen before.  Tough adventuring, big fantasy
world, friends and foes.  Take the time to know Shattered
World and you'll be richly rewarded!

Telnet      : origin.servegame.org 4454 [24.236.198.84]
WWW         : http://www.demuredemon.com
Description :

The world of Origin MUCK has an original, multi-faceted theme. The 
game is centered on 'the Realm', the name that mankind has given 
their worldly kingdom.

In the game, there is very little in the way of technology. The 
societies in the game are medieval in nature; the world is augmented
by magic, however, which is referred to as either 'Thaumaturgy' or 
'Sorcery' depending upon which country a character is from.

The Realm has enjoyed a relative state of peace for nearly two 
millenia after the fall of an evil king and the black Enemy of the 
south; however, changes are beginning to take place in the world, and
rumors are spreading of a growing power of darkness. The grip of fear
is quickly beginning to spread across the people of the land, and 
even to its neighbors, the titans. The word has journeyed across the 
southern borders that an army of eidolon has reformed, and a deadly 
silence has settled upon the gray plains.

Will you choose to be a member of the Legion, the strong and able 
defenders of the Realm who have chosen to serve the Magnates, the 
upholders of the Realm's law and peace? A simple citizen of the Realm?
Or perhaps a titan, one of the old and ancient friends of mankind, the
builders of Esh Nerago and the sturdiest of all races?

Or will you take your place among the ranks of the Eidolon, the 
lore-wise and secretive servants of the great Corrupter?

Description :

Portalis is a new MUD I have been working on for sometime. The
Codebase is Quickmud, which is constantly being modified to fit our
goal mechanics. Currently however, all of the changes have been purely
code related, and we are in need of builders to flesh out a detailed
world that fits our massive storyline and theme.

We currently offer: 7 Races, and 8 classes. Old Skills and Spells have
been removed and are being replaced by new ones. The Magic system is
undergoing a full rewrite, offering each magic class their own unique
casting system. Combat is also being modified to do away with the
standard auto-combat, and support is being added to allow for leveling
through roleplay.

I am currently looking for Builders, Coders, or anyone that would just
like to find a way to help out. Our OLC is being rewroked as well, to
provide more powerful creation tools for the staff. We are not ready
for and active playerbase, as we are still in our development stages,
but we dont mind visitors :)

Brief Theme Info:
Portalis, or the World of Portals, was formed by the ancient gods to
serve as a focal point for the labyrynth of realms they created. The
gods are now long dead to the inhabitants of the universe, mortals are
left to navigate the great nexus and defend themselves from the
horrors of the demonic realms on their own. Great arches stand open to
allow passage to many of the more well known worlds, while others can
only be reached by a magi who knows when and where to call a portal.
However, these passages are open to the darker forces as well, and
they use them to try and wedge their way into dominance of Portalis,
and control of its portals. Do you have what it takes to exists here?

Immortals are always on, and glad to help anyone out that decides to
join.

The main focus of Galatic Chaos is roleplaying. Our goal is to create 
an environment which promotes in character activity. Roleplaying will
be heavily moderated and rewarded.

Start playing now and have the oppurtunity to join powerful clans, 
have force powers, and be among the strongest players in the game.

As everyone knows, the Legendary DBSaga codebase was released about a

 is where Saga 2.0 left off, when the Owner at the time, Goku, had 
disappeared. Come, and enjoy what could have, and should have been.
 We're newbie friendly, helpful, and simply easy to get along with.
 Come aboard, and join the fun!

Note: We are fully open, though we are still working on
the MUD, so expect a few changes during gameplay. And

Description :

The world of EdenMUSH is a world in which technology and magic
co-exist, sometimes in peacefull collaboration and at other times in
violent opposition. Eden is a place of mystery, romance and adventure.
Where even the land on which you walk holds far greater secrets than
you could ever imagine. A well read member of present day society may
recognize in Eden elements of a late medieval, early renaissance and
even victorian earth, but Eden is none of these. The airborne island
of Eden is a world within itself, in a time within itself.

EdenMUSH is an originaly themed mush with elements from innumerable
sources, including popular liturature, films, television and video
games. Even so Eden is not any of these places and the chance of
seeing someone out of these sources is unlikely... all likenesses to
any people or events as they say, are unintentional. At EdenMUSH we
hope to offer the players an interesting and exciting roleplaying
environment, while still leaving room for expansion and growth based
upon the ideas of the player's themselves. And while we encourage our
players to roleplay we don't enforce it, we instead aim for a friendly
and fun place where you can socialize with the other players.

Come and join us, won't you?

- Fight pirates at the edges of the 'zone'. Run guns under
the well-armed nose of the Fleet. Duck through the sewers of
the megacorp worlds, and sneer at the most dangerous fringers.
The Grimsyn Sector. You might get rich, you might get famous.
You might never leave.
- Grimsyn Encounter is set in the shatterzone Universe, focusing
on a string of planets at the distant fringes of the known galaxy.
These worlds are set against the back-drop of the 'shatterzone',
a massive mainly unexplored space anomaly that has eluded
definitive explanation for centuries, and has spurred a hundred
religions and given birth to countless doctrines of faith and
scientific method. The date starts roughly in the year 2576 AD,
during a time when humanity itself is threatened by its own
misguided ambition.
- Grimsyn Encounter is a detailed setting, developed to advance
the scope of science-fiction/fantasy and bring one of the most
action-packed graphic space adventure RPGs to life. Here you will
witness new hopes, unsolved mysteries, epic conquests, and heroic
deeds. These are the tales of your characters-- of their triumphs
and of their defeats.

Yes we are back - after many hosting and server problems which

--------------------------------------------------------------------
It was a time long before all there is today, when the Creator god
of all was alone, ages before there where any peoples and gods to
lead us. All that was made was done, new for the first and only
times, at the birth of a new creation.

...Time Passed as millenia flowed into millenia...

Thus from that time till now have mortal men been separated from the
realm of the gods. Forced to rely more on their own ways to build and
flourish within the realm that the gods have created for them. Never
again to cross the boundary between the realms, for this mysterious
force that shimmers with the light of many fires in darkness, this
Shi'Da, these Shadowfires that the gods didst place about this world,
will forever isolate man from the realm of our gods.

Description :

   Anitaverse is very similar to world of darkness, for those of you
who have ever played WoD, believe it or not. Yes, the books trickle 
off into what has been described as 'soft porn' well, that doesn't 
mean that our games have to do the same. In Anitaverse, vampires, 
werewolves, and various other were-things exist and humans know about
them! There can be, if players are imaginitative, even more suspense 
and 'horror' in Anitaverse than in WoD because you WON'T GET KILLED if
you tease that crazy human who's terrified of vampires with what 
you are! Tease us, torment us, just dont kill us! ;) It's all 
good.

   And hey, maybe even if you do kill us it's good too (though it 
is illegal)! I, as the Goddess am going to work -very- hard to keep
this game active with tps and other things to keep players involved.
I understand people have and form relationships and want to be alone 
at times. But I do not want to see people always staying locked away 
in private. Come out, roleplay! Have some fun! :) Also, just because
you're a vampire or a shifter or a mortal+ does -not- mean that 
automatically people -know- what you are. No. You either tell them,
or they have powers themselves and can sense it. Some supers or, on
as they're called in Anitaverse 'preturnaturals' can even hide what
they are from others, even of their own kind.

    I'll have more information up in-game, soon. So come on by and 
visit us! We would love to see you. And we are accepting builders 
and coders at this time, as well. We are -not- using SGP so are in
the process of coding everything from scratch, including our own
chargen. We do have a stat/sheet system, but it is -very- simple 
and it is -not- something we concentrate on. It is for fun, and 
to help divvy out who's who and what's what more easily. It 
should be a -fun- thing. On CD, we focus on -ROLEPLAY- not 
-ROLLPLAY-. Please don't be scared away by the fact that we 
have a sheet system. It is -very- simple and takes very 
little time to set on yourself, 5-10 minutes tops if you need 
help on figuring things out. We will have news files to aid 
you.

     So, please come check us out! We are waiting to accept 
you into our arms... Darkness is falling... the time grows 
near... won't you come ... show no fear.

This is a Mindcloud 2 clone gimmick yada yada.

This mud is owned by someone who DESPISES every Godwars currently
out there in this spinning little internet sphere, but loves the
concept of what each one TRIES to be.

I chose Mindcloud because, even though every one I've ever played
is extremely unbalanced and unplayable unless you have a horde of
friends backing you 24/7, I like the way it plays.

I'm not big on spending a month maxxing out a character to PK,
so don't count on spending countless hours here killing mobs.
This mud is designed for Player Killing, and that's it.
I've upped the normal Mindcloud Statcap from 50k to 500k.
I am however leaving status statcap the way it is, at an
additional 10k per status you have.  The reason for this is,
because I beleive that while being

Description :

The Icerian Empire secretly plot their takeover of Earth, patiently 
waiting for the opportune moment to strike. With the death of the
last Z Warrior recorded the Armada sent out a fleet, conquering
Earth in a matter of days.  The Human race was enslaved and forced
to do the bidding of their conquerers. Much to the dismay of the
Icers, it seemed their new pets were weak, pathetic and thus not
worthy of servitude. Planet Earth was deemed a waste of resources
and ordered to be destroyed once the Dragonballs had been collected.
The Icers found something more precious in return without having to
put effort into searching, the Blackstar Dragonballs. With the
Earthlings being worthless the Dragoballs were used to restore their
most manipulatable and efficient servants of all time.  The Saiyan
race.
 
The small group of Humans that were not destroyed by the vicious
onslaught of their conquerers managed to board ships off of the
planet before the core imploded . Without a home and their moral
damaged the Humans fled deep into space to find a hiding place. In
return finding a planet where they made their new home and started
over. This planet was slightlysmaller then the original Earth but
the creatures and atmosphere were quite alike, it was named Earth II.
 
Time gradually passed with the Icerian Armada dominating planets at
the expense of their servants. They were lured into a false sense of
security thinking their brutes will never attempt another uprising.
To their surprise the Saiyan race did indeed stand up against the
Icers with formidable force, the result was victory for the warrior
race. Hundred of years had passed since the Saiyans were declared
free but the Universe was never restored to a peaceful place, the
taint of evil seemed to continiously grow and spread. Earth II grew
over time into a well known Port-of-call for all varieties of races,
forcing their economic status to grow and flourish.

WWW         : http://huntbh.home.comcast.net/bob
Description :

This Project has been under heavy development for 4 years.
While it is fully playable, we are also continuing with Beta
testing. The mud is generally very stable with regular code
additions. There are already dozens of interesting features 
that provide lasting gameplay. This is the mud for anyone 
who loves computer role playing games.

* Vast random equipment system based loosely on Diablo.
* Research and crafting help narrow down item searches.
* Diverse skill groups allow for deep class customization
  while effective classes can be chosen for simplicity.
* Numerous event and quest options for a fresher experience.
* Strong emphasis on player enjoyment and conveniences. 
* Territorial clan control system.
* Free grouping system for players of all levels to team up.
* Deep combat stat system where players may succeed through
  specialization or balance.
* Perk advancement system offers nearly endless development
  beyond a player's mastered skills and max level. Upgrade 
  abilities, boost talents, raise important stats and more.
* Newbie friendly Admin staff and game information. There is
  much to learn, but everything is geared towards helping.
* NPC trading system for passive item acquisition.
* Random exploration events provide alternate leveling methods.
* Many other smaller features add to the variety and fun of 
  regular game play. 

The majority of the codebase has been revamped or replaced 
resulting in over three times the original program size. A
more fantasy-based theme is under consideration, but you
will find countless ways to adventure and actually play
your character in our ever-growing world. Some will even
have the opportunity to help us shape it.

Description :

Those with a fear of change, stay away. You have been warned.
Welcome to the second brainchild of a positively great coder,
Keolah Kedaire. Her first mud died because it became so far from
normal that we could no longer attract new players. This time, we 
hope to keep things more... humane. But this is not your normal mud.
Currently in the early stages, this mud already has began
differentiating itself from your boring stock smaugs. It has quad-
classing, and choosing a good combo of our homebrew classes is vital
to your success. The mud's biggest shortcoming at the moment lies in
its areas, which are mostly stock but it's only been running a few
weeks and we are currently building new areas. So, if you're bored
and looking for a change of pace, and a mud loaded with people that
love nothing more than to have fun, welcome to ElkanduMUD (working

Description :

Okay, right now, there is not much of a MUD that anyone (including
myself) could speak of. I can tell you right now, there is 
absolutely no game-play value in the MUD, and if you're looking 
for a playable MUD then I don't suggest this one. :) Of course,
that doesn't mean you're not welcome, by all means, visit, 
connect, and have a yarn if either myself or Angela is around.

Basically, the codebase is currently in the first, initial, stages 
of creation... which is the server framework. And the reason why 
I am posting this is so that people who are interested can at 
least try the server if they wish.

I'm also interested in talking to people who have ideas... on 
what should or shouldn't go into a codebase. The code is in its 
infancy, and it is not at the point where it would be 
extraordinarily difficult to put things on the To Do or To 
Don't list. 

What do you like about MUDs? What do you hate? Tell me!

Like I said, there's no game to speak of right now, but you're 
welcome to visit and help guide the developement of a new MUD. :)

Email me if you have ideas or had issues with the server...

Description :

Hello All,

For those of you who remember The Lords Arena, I welcome
you for those of you who don't I pity you.  Anyway, this 
mud will be a tribute mud to The Lords Arena, which is a 
very high standard to live up to indeed.  I hope that 
any player who enjoyed playing The Lords Arena will stop 
in and at least give creative suggestions though all 
suggestions are welcome from new or old players.

I spent quite a bit of time at The Lords Arena while it 
was up and though there were many players older than 
myself I was quite old.  But that matters not, what i am
attempting to do is bring back a stable mud to meet the 
requirements of what The Lords Arena once was.  My main 
goal at the moment is to create a stable dystopia themed 
mud that is similar to what existed when The Lords Arena 
was shut down.  This however may be an endless task as I 
do not have access to their base; I am using a new 
dystopia 1.2 base.

My first and main concern will be stability and enhancing
existing features and playability after that is 
accomplished I will likely move on to adding new features 
classes and functionality.

Thanks to all who read this,

  We have once again started back up after being able to move to a 
brand new server in Dallas, Texas! We are set up on an OC-12

  We're starting from scratch from a new code base derived from 
the circle codebase, called rasputin, which uses the open gaming
license, and is based off of the D-20 ruleset. We are basing our 
MUD off of Robert Jordan's Wheel of time series, and trying as hard
as possible to stick to the books when it comes to zones and role 
play.
  Channelers will not be a chooseable class, but will rather be remort
class, as will be fades, greymen, swordmasters, and wolfbrothers. Most
advancement will come through experience point gain, but will also be
a reward for good roleplaying. This is also an unrestricted pk mud, 
but law enforcement is also left up to the players with Immortals 
playing as the Kings and queens of land to help enforce

	Age Of Tyranny (AoT) is a new MUD based on the CircleMUD3.1
platform. We have rewritten the entire skill/spell system 
as well as altered the combat system so that battles involve 
a tad more skill then just attacking something and waiting to 
see if it dies. We are a classless mud with expertise based 
skill and spell system. You assign points (earned by leveling) 
into one of many different areas of expertise and can then 
learn skills and spells based on  your level of knowledge 
in that certain area of expertise (ie: Diablo II). 
We are also working on the ability to have Player controlled 
cities with an advanced economic system. 

	The MUD itself is based on custom world called 
Ultima Terra (Latin translated means the last land). Players 
start in a city called Kel-Moraine which is off the coast of 
Damaar. Kel-Moraine is under attack from several rival 
cities including Astoria and its Tyrant ruler. All zones will

It was a time of peace and joyful endings for decades. 
Wars were unheard of in this realm until a strange man 
by the name of Yerte summoned a strange gate. He called 
this gate the Apocalyptic Gate.. The citizens gathered 
around the strange gate for days until one day it opened. 
As it opened a large demon exited the gate decapitating 
them one by one. The citizens cried for help as the fiend 
devoured them, but in the distance a howls could be heard. 
From out of nowhere a pack of black and white furred beasts 
came to assist the citizens. As they grew close more demons 
poured out of the gate. It was that time, the war had finally 
arrived. Awaken all creatures of the realm and take your side, 
but their can only be one champion.

Apocalyptic Gate offers:

Classes: Mage, Demon, Werewolf, Angel, Monk, 
Ninja, Fae, and Vampire.

Hybrids: Nephandi, Skindancer, Lich, Abomination, 
Black Spiral Dancer, Baali, Hakken, Baiken, 
Starlit Cherub, Celestial Assassin, Celestial Howler, 
Defyler, Majestic Shadow, and Sohei.

*Classes in the works: Drow, Highlander, Kote, Dragons
*Hybrids in the works: Lloth, Sennin, and Elementalist
*Random Bonus EXP and QP system installed
*Removed clans to add kingdoms later

Currently we are still in the building process and are far 
from opening considering the classes, hybrids, helpfiles, 
and areas that need to be  created. You may drop in to chat 
or if you are a builder possibly aid in the construction 
of the Apocalyptic Gate.
