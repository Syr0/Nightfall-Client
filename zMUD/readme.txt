RELEASE NOTES for zMUD v7.20
============================

*** IMPORTANT NOTE FOR EXISTING zMUD USERS ***

If you don't read anything else, please READ THIS!

To prevent problems resulting from this upgrade, you MUST make a backup copy of your current zMUD directory.  Then install this upgrade into the SAME DIRECTORY as your old version of zMUD.  By making a copy of your current zMUD directory, you will still be able to run your existing version in case there is a problem with the upgrade.

Then, to upgrade your existing eLicense registration code, simply click the Upgrade button that appears on the 30-trial screen that you see when you first run this new version of zMUD.

This new version of zMUD no longer uses the eLicense copy protection system.  A new protection system is used which is much less intrusive.  However, the new system requires a new license key.  An upgrade program has been included to automatically upgrade your current eLicense registration code.  

-----
